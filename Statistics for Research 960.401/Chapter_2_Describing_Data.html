    <h2>Chapter 2: Describing Data</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Organising Data</b>
      <li>Data can be organised into graphs depending on the type of variable</li>
      
      <br><li><b>Pie Charts</b></li>
        <ul>Used for displaying categorial data</ul>
        <ul>The thickness of a "slice" represents the frequency of a variable's value</ul>
        <ul>Data is organised into a circle</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Bar Graphs</b></li>
        <ul>Used for displaying categorial data</ul>
        <ul>The height of a bar represents the frequency of a variable's value</ul>
        <ul>Data is organised into evenly-spaced bars that do not overlap</ul>
        <ul><b>Segmented Bar Graph</b>
          <li>Used for displaying 2 or more categorical variables</li>
          <li>The variables are expressed as distinct colours</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Side-by-Side Bar Graph</b>
          <li>Used for displaying 2 or more categorical variables</li>
          <li>Different variables are placed in specific regions of the graph</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Histogram</b></li>
        <ul>Used for displaying numerical data</ul>
        <ul>The height of the bar represents the frequency of a variable's value</ul>
        <ul>Data is organised into evenly-spaced bars that touch</ul>
        <ul>Data that increases in height then decreases at an equal amount is symmetric</ul>
        <ul>Data is considered bell-shaped if it has a parabolic shape (mean = median)</ul>
        <ul>Data that increases in height, but gradually decreases is asymmetric and skewed to the right (mean > median)</ul>
        <ul>Data that gradually increases in height, then decreases is asymmetric and skewed to the left (mean < median)</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Stem and Leaf Plot</b></li>
        <ul>Used for displaying numerical data</ul>
        <ul>Data is organised as a table containing a "Stems" on the left & a "Leaves" columns on the right. The Stems column contains the tens, hundreds.. and so on (other than the ones place) place whilst the Leaves column contains solely the one place of the elements. The elements within the Leaves column are usually placed in ascending order starting from 0. If the elements in the Leaves column are not in the ones place, they must be explicitly stated as the smallest given decimal value</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Dot Plot</b></li>
        <ul>Used for displaying numerical data</ul>
        <ul>Data is organised as a 1-dimesional plot containing stacked marks</ul>
        
      <br><li><b>Box Plot</b></li>
        <ul>Used for displaying numerical data</ul>
        <ul>Data is organised such that the values of a 5-Number Summary and outliers are all shown explicitly</ul>
        <ul>A box with length IQR is divided by the median. 2 lines stretch on opposite ends to demonstrate the lowest & highest relevant values</ul>
        
      <br><li><b>Side-by-Side Graphs</b></li>
        <ul>Used for displaying both numerical & categorical data</ul>
        <ul>Numerical data is first organised into a boxplot, dotplot or histogram. Then, every categorical variable corresponding to a set of numerical data is arranged side-by-side one another. Multiple graphs of numerical are therefore shown and arranged according to a categorical variable</ul>
      
      <br><li>Scatterplot</li>
        <ul>Used for displaying numerical data</ul>
        <ul>The values for 2 numerical variables are plotted as dots on a graph where one is plotted vertically and the otheris plotted horizontally</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Categorical Variables</b>
      <li>As mentioned in the previous example, categorical variables are variables that represent a non-numerical identity such as gender or education level</li>
      
      <br><li>The <b>proportion</b> or relative frequency/amount of participants in a certain category can be measured by dividing the number of participants in that category by the total number of participants</li>
        <ul>A <b>frequency table</b> may sometimes be used to observe the proportions in a study in the form of a table</ul>
        <ul>The proportion for a population is denoted by 'p'</ul>
        <ul>The proportion for a population is denoted by '<b>p</b>' or p with a hat</ul>
      
      <br><li>If there are 2 or more categorical variables within a study, a 2-way table may be used to observe a possible relationship/association between the 2 variables</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 1: </b>
      <li>In a sample of n = 2625 adult participants, a nationwide telephone survey was conducted. This survey asked each participant 3 questions: 1) Do you agree that there is one true love for each person? 2) What is your gender? 3) What is your highest level of education?_
        Out of the 2625 participants, 735 agreed, 1812 disagreed, and 78 were unsure for the first question.
        Out of the 2625 participants, 372 males agreed, 807 males disagreed, 363 females agreed and 1005 females disagreed. There are 1213 males & 1412 females in total.
        Answer the following questions related to this survey: a) What is the proportion of people who agree, disagree and are unsure with the first question? b) What is the proportion of females and males who agree?</li>
      
        <br><ul>a)
          <li>agreeProportion = 735 / 2625</li>
          <li>agreeProportion = 0.28</li>
          
          <br><li>disagreeProportion = 1812 / 2625</li>
          <li>disagreeProportion = 0.69</li>
          
          <br><li>unsureProportion = 78 / 2625</li>
          <li>unsureProportion = 0.03</li>
          
          <br><li>total1 = 1</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul>b)
          <li>femaleAgree = 363 / 1412</li>
          <li>femaleAgree = 0.26</li>
          
          <br><li>maleAgree = 372 / 1213</li>
          <li>maleAgree = 0.31</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Shape & Centering for One Quantitative Variable</b>
      <li>As mentioned in the previous chapter, quantitative variables give a numerical value for a characteristic</li>
      
      <br><li>An <b>outlier</b> is a value of a variable that is noticeably different from other variables. In other words, it lies outside a median range of values; it can be either much higher of much smaller than the average</li>
      
      <br><li>Dotplots or histograms are often used to observe the distribution of data</li>
      
      <br><li>The <b>mean</b> is the average of all data values for one variable. In a graph, it is the point that balances out the dataset. It is the sum of all values x divided by the total number n of values: </li>
        <ul>avg = Σ<sub>k = 1</sub><sup>n</sup>(x<sub>k</sub>) / n</ul>
        <ul>A common way to express mean in a sample is x with a line over it. In a population, μ is used</ul>
      
      <br><li>The <b>median</b> of a dataset is the middle value. If there is an even number of values in the dataset, the average of both middle values is found. The median gives information about each half of the dataset</li>
      
      <br><li><b>Resistance</b> demonstrates the impact of outliers within the dataset, that is, how they affect the median & mean. Generally, the more outliers, the more the mean is affected</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 2: </b>
      <li>In an ICU admissions study, 200 patients were studied based on their age, gender, race, heart rate, BP, CPR administration, and survival. Out of all the patients, there were 5 20-year old patients & 8 55-year old patients. The heart rates (beats per min) for the 20-year old patients were: 108, 68, 80, 83, 72. The HR for the 55-year old patients were 86, 86, 92, 100, 112, 116, 136, 140. 
      Answer the following questions relating to this study: a) What is the median for the 2 categorised patients? b) What is the mean for the 2 categorised patients? c) How would the data be affected if the HR of 108 were replaced with 200 in the 55-year old patients?</li>
      
        <br><ul>a)
          <li>Placing the values in order: 68, 72, 80, 83, 108</li>
          
          <br><li>median20yo = 80</li>
          
          <br><li>median55yo = 106</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul>b)
          <li>mean20yo = (68 + 72 + 80 + 83 + 108) / 5</li>
          <li>mean20yo = 82.2</li>
          
          <br><li>mean55yo = (86 + 86 + 92 + 100 + 112 + 116 + 136 + 140) / 8</li>
          <li>mean55yo = 108.5</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul>c)
          <li>The median would not be affect by the drastic change in HR; it woud be resistant. However, the mean would be greatly affected</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Measures of Spread for One Quantitative Variable</b>
      <li>It is important to take into account how far spread out the data is. This is done by calculating the standard deviation & z-score of the dataset</li>
      
      <br><li>The <b>summary statistics</b> is a table that lays out the crucial statistics of a corresponding dataset. This includes the size, mean, standard deviation, minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum</li>
      
      <br><li>The <b>deviation</b> of a dataset refers to how far it deviates from the <b>norm</b> or average. It is calculated by taking the difference of an element of interest & the mean: </li>
        <ul>deviation = element - mean</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Standard deviation</b> (std) is the statistic that measures the variability of the dataset as a whole. In other words, it is a measurement of how spread out the data is and how far each element deviates from the norm. This is commonly used (along with the mean) when every element in a dataset is relevant and must be taken into account. Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is calculated by taking the sum of squared deviations of each datset, dividing by n - 1 (where n = size) and square rooting the result: </li>
        <ul class="red">std = sqrt(Σ((dataset[] - mean)<sup>2</sup>) / (size - 1))</ul>
        <ul>std = sqrt(Σ<sub>k = 1</sub><sup>n</sup>(x<sub>k</sub> - mean)<sup>2</sup> / (n - 1))</ul>
        
        <br><ul>std is denoted as s in a sample and σ in a population</ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>The 95% Rule</b>
          <li>To get an idea of the magnitude of standard deviation, in a symmetric, bell shaped dataset, 95% of the data lies within 2 standard deviations from the mean. In other words, this data falls within the interval of [mean ± 2(std)]</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>The <b>z-score</b> is a measure of how many standards deviations away an element lies from the mean. It is calculated by taking dividing the deviation by the standard deviation: </li>
        <ul class="red">z-score = deviation / std</ul>
        <ul>z-score = (element - mean) / sqrt(Σ((dataset[] - mean)<sup>2</sup>) / (size - 1))</ul>
        
        <br><ul>Only about 5% of the data will have a z-score higher than 2 or lower than -2</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Percentiles</b> are the percentages of participants in a sample with a value less than or equal to a value of interest. For instance, a score in the 80th precentile means 80% of participants scored equal to or lower than the observed participant</li>
      
      <br><li><b>5-Number Summary</b></li>
        <ul>A tuple containing the minimum, first quartile (25th percentile), median, third quartile (75th percentile), and maximum in that order. This gives a summary of the overall distribution of a dataset</ul>
      
      <br><li>The <b>range</b> is the difference between the maximum & minimum values. This gives summary of the magnitude of how distributed the data is</li>
      <li>The <b>interquartile range</b> (IQR) is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) & first quartile (Q1). This gives an approximate of the spread of most of the data. This is commonly used (along with the median) when there are no outliers</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 3: </b>
      <li>Average temperatures (in °F) were recorded in Des Moines, Iowa & San Francisco, California on every 14th of April from 1994-2015: DesMoines = [56.0, 37.5, 37.2, 56.0, 54.3, 63.3, 54.7, 60.6, 70.6, 53.7, 52.9, 74.9, 44.4, 40.3, 44.4, 71.0, 56.8, 59.2, 53.3, 35.7, 56.2];  SanFrancisco = [51.0, 55.3, 55.7, 48.7, 56.2, 57.2, 49.5, 61.0, 51.4, 55.8, 53.0, 58.1, 54.2, 53.4, 49.9, 53.8, 51.4, 52.3, 52.1, 57.3, 55.8] Give the summary statistics of the 2 datasets.</li>
      
        <br><ul>The summary statistics can be determined using a programming software like Python: 
          <li>meanDS = 53.95;  meanSF = 53.96;</li>
          <li>medianDS = 54.7;  medianSF = 53.8;</li>
          <li>stdDS = 11.05;  stdSF = 3.15;</li>
          <li>fiveNumSumDS = (35.7, 44.4, 54.7, 59.9, 74.9);  fiveNumSumSF = (48.7, 51.4, 53.8, 56.0, 61.0); </li>
          <li>rangeDS = 39.2;  rangeSF = 12.3;</li>
          <li>IQRDS = 15.5;  IQRSF = 4.6;</li>
          <li>Based on the data, both Des Moines & San Francisco have very similar means and medians. Although, the spread of the data varies greatly. Des Moines has a higher spread (greater variability) and therefore a higher standard deviation (deviation from the norm)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 4: </b>
      <li>In an ICU study, the systolic blood pressure & heart rate for many patients were recorded. The mean for BP was 132.3mmHg and its standard deviation was 32.95mmHg. The mean for HR was 98.9bpm and its standard deviation was 26.83bpm.
      One of the patients had a high systolic blood pressure of 204 mmHg and a low pulse rate of 52 bpm. Which of these values is more unusual relative to the other patients in the sample?</li>
        
        <br><ul>Calculating the z-scores for the patient's BP & HR: 
          <li>zScoreBP = (204 - 132.3) / 32.95</li>
          <li>zScoreBP = 2.18</li>
          
          <br><li>zscoreHR = (52 - 98.9) / 26.83</li>
          <li>zScoreHR = -1.75</li>
          
          <br><li>Based on the 2 z-scores, it can be concluded that the patient's BP was more unusual because it had a higher z-score, meaning this value deviated farther from the mean</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Relationships between Categorical & Quantitative Variables</b>
      <li>To mathematically determine whether an element is an outlier, it is compared to the value of (Q1 - 1.5 IQR) and (Q3 + 1.5 IQR). If the value of interest is less than the first comparison or last comparision, it is, indeed, an outlier: </li>
        <ul>if(element < (Q1 - (1.5 * IQR)) || element > (Q3 + (1.5 * IQR))) {outliers[n] = element}</ul>
      
      <br><li>Side-by-side graphs are optimal for comparing categorical & quantitative variables. An exaxmple of this is a study that measures the weekly average amount of time watching television according to a person's gender</li>
      
      <br><li>Taking the difference of means within numerical data of 2 different categories gives insight to the relationship between the 2 categorical variables</li>
      
      <br><li>Summary statistics, as mentioned previously, provides strong data of the distribution, spread and centre points of multiple categorical variables with associated numerical data</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Correlation between 2 Quantitative Variables</b>
      <li>Scatterplots are an ideal tool to use for visualising the relationship between the values of 2 numerical variables</li>
      
      <br><li><b>Correlation</b> is a measure of the magnitude & direction (vector properties) of the linear association between 2 numerical variables</li>
        <ul>Correlation in a sample is denoted as r, whilst in a population, is denoted by ρ</ul>
        <ul>It is calculated as follows: 
          <li class="red">correlation = Σ(zScore1 * zScore2) / (size - 1)</li>
          <li>correlation = Σ(((dataset1[] - mean1) / std1) * ((dataset2[] - mean2) / std2)) / (size - 1)</li>
          <li>r = Σ<sub>k = 1</sub><sup>n</sup>(((x<sub>k</sub> - mean<sub>x</sub>) / s<sub>x</sub>) * ((y<sub>k</sub> - mean<sub>y</sub>) / s<sub>y</sub>)) / (n - 1)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Values of correlation range from -1 to 1 where a higher magnitude corresponds to a more linear association between 2 numerical variables. Negative values imply negative correlation and positive values imply positive correlation</ul>
        <ul>Strong correlations do not imply a cause & effect relationship</ul>
        <ul>Outliers may greatly affect the outcome of correlations</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 5: </b>
      <li>The following data lists the last 12 US presidents' approval rating and margin of election outcome: 
      {

          <li>Based on the data, there does, in fact, appear to be an association between the approval ratings & marginal outcomes of each president</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul>b)
          <li>When plotting the approval rating & margin of victory on their corresponding axes, it is observed that there is a somewhat linear & positive correlation between the 2 variables</li>

          <li>Based on the correlation value, it can be concluded that there is a very strong linear correlation between cricket chirp rate & local temperature!</li>

    <ul class="topic"><b>Linear Regression</b>
      <li><b>Linear Regression</b> is the method used for approximating a line of best fit within a set of datapoints. It is commonly used to predict a value given the result of the slope of the regression line and an explanatory/independent variable</li>
        <ul>The regression line takes the form of a line, having the equation y = bx + c, where y = response/dependent variable, x = explanatory/independent variable, b = slope & c = constant</ul>
        <ul>x & y (the 2 variables) cannot be used interchangedly</ul>
        <ul>A predicted response is sometimes denoted by "y with a hat" or simply Y</ul>
        <ul>The equation of a regression line is also called the <b>prediction equation</b></ul>
        <ul>Formally, the slope of the line represents the change in y divided by the change in x (differential of y). In other words, it represents the change in the predicted value for a specific change in independent variable (usually one). The intercept is the value of y when x == 0 (y-intercept)</ul>
        <ul>For a sample, the slope of the regression line is denoted by b. For a population, it is denoted as β</ul>
        <ul>Predicted data based on the prediction equation should only be used for valid values of an explanatory variable. Choosing a value for the independent variable that is too far from its normal range is referring to as extrapolating the data too far</ul>
        <ul>Data having a curved (exponential) trend cannot be regressed linearly</ul>
        <ul>Outliers are influential points that can greatly affect linear regression; it is good practice to remove them before regressing</ul>
      
      <br><li>The <b>residual</b> is the difference between the predicted value and the actual value of the response variable for a given explanatory variable. It is also referred to as the vertical deviation/distance from the regression line: </li>
        <ul class="red">residual = actual - predicted</ul>
        <ul>residual = y - Y</ul>
        <ul>Deviations above the line have a positive residual & deviations below the line have a negative residual</ul>
      
      <br><li>The <b>line of best fit</b> corresponds to the regression line with predicted values that have the smallest squared residuals: </li>
        <ul>line = min(residuals[]<sup>2</sup>)</ul>
        <ul>line = min((actual[] - predicted[])<sup>2</sup>)</ul>

      <li>The owner of a bistro restaurant in New York collected the bills of 157 customers to observe the relationship between the total bill amount and the tip left for the server. It was found that there was a correlation of r = 0.915 and a regression equation of Y = 0.182 x - 0.292, where Y = predicted tip amount and x = total bill. Answer the following questions relating to this observation: 
      a) Using the regression equation, predict the tip given if the bill is [$59.33, $9.52, $23.70].
      b) Calculate the residuals if the actual tips for the given the bill amounts were [$10.00, $1.00, $10.00]
      c) Describe the changes in slope and intercept in terms on the context.
      </li>
      
        <br><ul>a)
          <li>Y[] = 0.182 [59.33, 9.52, 23.70] - 0.292</li>
            <ul>tip1 = 10.51;  tip2 = 1.44;  tip3 = 4.02;</ul>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul>b)
          <li>residuals[] = [10.00, 1.00, 10.00] - [10.51, 1.44, 4.02]</li>
            <ul>residual1 = -0.51;  residual2 = -0.44;  residual3 = 5.98;</ul>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul>c)
          <li>The slope represents the change in the tip amount for every dollar added (marginal dollar) of the bill amount. An equivalent of $0.182 of tip would increase for every marginal bill dollar</li>
          <li>The intercept represents the tip amount for a bill of $0.00. In theory for this case, there would be a tip amount of -$0.292 if the bill were $0.00</li>
