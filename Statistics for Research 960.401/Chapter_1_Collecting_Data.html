    <h2>Chapter 1: Collecting Data</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>The Structure of Data</b>
      <li class="blue">Statistics is the science of collecting, organising, summarising & analysing data</li>
      
      <li>It is said that new amount of information & data doubles per year</li>
      <li>Analysing data is relevant to almost any career path and is very applicable</li>
      
      <br><li>There are 2 types of statistic methods: </li>
        <ul><b>Descriptive</b>
          <li>Focuses on collecting, organising & summarising data</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Inferential</b>
          <li>Focuses on making conclusions about a population based on the sample drawn</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <ul class="topic"><b>Cases & Variables</b>
      <li class="blue">A variable is a characteristic that is specific to a person or object</li>
      <li>Variables can be either categorial/qualitative or numerical/quantitative</li>
      <li>They usually correspond to the number of columns in a dataset, unlike cases which correspond to the number of relevant rows</li>
      
      <br><li>The first column or row that has the names of the variables is the <b>identifier column/row</b></li>
      
      <br><li><b>Categorial/Qualitative Variable</b></li>
        <ul>A non-numerical name for a characteristic/group</ul>
        <ul>No algebraic or mathematical computations can be performed on these variables</ul>
        <ul>Examples include blood group, street address, gender</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Numerical/Quantitative Variable</b></li>
        <ul>A dimension for measuring the amount of something</ul>
        <ul>Algebraic/mathematical computations can be performed on these variables</ul>
        <ul>Can be either discrete or continuous
          <li>Discrete variables are countable and can only take specific intervals; like number of cars or shoe size</li>
          <li>Continuous variables vary over time and can include any decimal within an interval; like waiting time</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Examples include time, weight, height, distance</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Explanatory Variables</b></li>
        <ul>Variables that explain other the existence or change for response variables</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Response Variables</b></li>
        <ul>Variables that respond or react to explanatory variables</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Collecting Data</b>
      <li>A <b>population</b> is the set of all units/elements in a study. Denoted by "N"</li>
        <ul>A <b>sample</b> is a subset of the population. Denoted by "n"
          <li>Random samples are best for collecting data and/or conducting experiments</li>
          <li>Destructive testing on a sample damages or wastes the product and/or sample. This includes car crash testing or tasting food. Dummies or animals or usually used for destructive testing</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Statistical inference</b> is the process of using data collected from a sample to make inferences about the entire population</li>
      
      <br><li>Sometimes the information gathered from a sample is not faithful. This occurs when <b>sampling bias</b> is used (Selecting a sample to the advantage of the researcher). Volunteers may also be considered sampling bias. Bias, in general, may inaccurately represent a population</li>
      
      <br><li><b>Methods of Sampling</b></li>
        <ul><b>Simple Random Sample (SRS)</b>
          <li>Randomly selected samples containing equal amount of participants</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Systematic Sampling</b>
          <li>An interval amount is chosen as "k". A sample is chosen for every k-th interval in the population</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Stratified Sampling</b>
          <li>Data is divided into strata/groups that share common traits (homogenous)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Cluster Sampling
          <li>Data is divided into random clusters/groups, which are then divided further for sampling (heterogenous)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Types of Studies</b>
      <li><b>Association</b> demonstrates a correlation between 2 variables</li>
      <li><b>Causation</b> implies one variable directly affects the value of another variable</li>
      
      <br><li><b>Confounding factors/variables</b> is an external variable that affects the relationship between 2 associated variables</li>
      
      <br><li>An <b>experiment</b> is a study where explanatory variables are controlled by the researcher</li>
        <ul>A <b>randomised experiment</b> is an experiment where the values of the explanatory variables are randomly chosen. Choosing these variables randomly is essential to concluding a causal relationship. Generally, the more random an experiment, the more faithful the results. Types of randomised experiments include:
          <li><b>Randomised Comparative Experiment</b></li>
            <ul>Cases are randomly assigned only one out of more treatments. The results of the response variables for each case is then compared</ul>
          <li><b>Matched Pairs Experiment</b></li>
            <ul>Cases receive all treatments in a random order. The response variables for individual cases are then compared</ul>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>An <b>observational study</b> is a study where no variables are controlled by the researcher, rather, are observed in their natural form</li>
      
      <br><li>A <b>control group</b> is the group of participants in a sample that did not receive a treatment. They should not affect the outcome of the response variable</li>
      
      <br><li>The <b>placebo effect</b> is the phenomenom where a person receiving a <b>placebo</b> or fake/dummy treatment obtains the predicted response in an experiment</li>
      
      <br><li><b>Blinding</b> is a tactic that can be used to strength the integrity of experiments: </li>
        <ul>In a <b>single-blind experiment</b>, only researchers know which group is receiving their treatment; participants do not know</ul>
        <br><ul>In a <b>double-blind experiment</b>, neither the researchers nor participants have knowledge of whom receives the respective treatment</ul>
    </ul>
