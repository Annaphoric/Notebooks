    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 4: </b>
      <ol>Given {f(x, y, z) = y sin(x) + 2yz}, estimate how much the change in f (df) is if the initial point P = (0, 1, 0) moves 0.1 units towards the terminal point Q = (2, 2, -2).

        <ul class="red">f(c, d) ≈ L(x, y) = f(a, b) + (∂f(a, b)/∂x)(x - a) + (∂f(a, b)/∂y)(y - b)</ul>
        <ul>L(x, y) is the plane tangent to the surface made by z = f(x, y) at the point P. This is analagous to the line made by linearisation of a single-variable function using a relative point</ul>

      <ol>Find the linearisation of {f(x, y) = x<sup>2</sup> - xy + y<sup>2</sup>/2 + 3} at point P = (3, 2).

    <ul class="topic"><b>Differentials of Multivariable Functions</b>
      <li>For single-variable functions like y = f(x), the change in f (Δf) indicates the change in the value of the function as x changes from a to {a + Δx}: </li>

      <br><li>The same concept applies for multivariable functions. Assume z = f(x, y) is differentiable and its partial derivatives exist at a point P = (a, b). When moving from this point to a nearby point, the change in f (Δf) is respresented as: </li>

      <li>Applying linearisation to the function at the given point, the change in linearisation (ΔL) is demonstrated as: </li>
        <ul>ΔL = L(a + Δx, b + Δy) - L(a, b)</ul>
        <ul>ΔL = (∂f(a, b)/∂x)Δx + (∂f(a, b)/∂y)Δy</ul>

    <ul class="example"><b>Example 6: </b>
      <ol>Suppose a cylindrical can is expected to have a radius r = 1in & height h = 5in. When making the can, it is found that the radius & height are off by dr = +0.03 & dh = -0.1. Estimate the absolute change in the volume of making this can relative to its blueprint.
        
        <br><br><li>The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr<sup>2</sup>h. The partial derivatives of V(r, h) in terms of r & h are: </li>
          <ul>∂V/∂r = 2πrh; ∂V/∂h = πr<sup>2</sup>;</ul>
        
        <br><li>Evaluating the partial derivatives according to the blueprint values: </li>
          <ul>∂V(1, 5)/∂r = 10π; ∂V(1, 5)/∂h = π;</ul>
        
        <br><li>The change in volume of the actual can relative to the blueprint values is most approximated to be the value of its absolute differential (dV)</li>
          <ul>ΔV ≈ dV = (∂V(1, 5)/∂r)dr + (∂V(1, 5)/∂h)dh</ul>

    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 7: </b>
      <ol>My company manufactures stainless steel circular cylindrical molasses storage tanks that are 25ft high and have a radius of 5ft. How sensitive are the tanks' volumes to small variations in height & radii?
      
        <br><br><li>let r = 5, h = 25; The partial derivatives of V(r, h) evaluated at the given radius & height are: </li>
          <ul>∂V(r, h)/∂r = 2πrh; ∂V(r, h)/∂h = πr<sup>2</sup>;</ul>
          <ul>∂V(5, 25)/∂r = 250π; ∂V(5, 25)/∂h = 25π;</ul>
        
        <br><li>The absolute differential dV is calculated as: </li>
          <ul>dV = (∂V(5, 25)/∂r)dr + (∂V(5, 25)/∂h)dh</ul>
          <ul>dV = 250π dr + 25π dh</ul>
          <ul class="green">Based on my result, a change in radius would cause a more drastic affect in volume (by a factor of 250π) compared to the same change in height (by only a factor of 25π). A large partial derivative indicates a more sensitive change in an independent variable. Nevertheless, if the original blueprint value of height was higher by a certain amount, the change in height would be more sensitive than the radius. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sensitivity of the volume based on its radius & height is more affected by the original values, rather than the change in independent variables</ul>
