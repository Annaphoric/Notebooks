    <h2>Section 12.6: Cylinders & Quadric Surfaces</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Cylinders</b> 
      <li class="blue">A <b>cylinder</b> in space is made by moving a line along a curved plane while remaining orthogonal to a normal line segment to the plane of the line</li> 
        <ul>The curve made by the line is called a <b>generating curve</b></ul> 
    </ul> 
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 1: </b> 
      <ol>Find an equation for the cylinder made by lines parallel to the z-axis (perpendicular to the xy-plane) and perpendicular to the parabola = {y = x<sup>2</sup>, z = 0}.
      
        <br><br><li>Assume there is an initial point P of the parabola. Any terminal point Q that has the same x &amp; y-coordinates but a different z-coordinate as the parabola lies on the curved plane that makes up the parabola. The equation of this curved plane enclosed by the area of the parabola is a cylinder; it will be expressed as: </li> 
          <ul class="green">Cylinder = {y = x<sup>2</sup> for z ∈ (-∞, ∞)}</ul> 
      </ol> 
    </ul> 
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Quadric Surfaces</b> 
      <li class="blue">A <b>quadric surface</b> is a graph in space that is formed using a polynomial of 2<sup>nd</sup> degree for all or either of x, y, & z </li> 
   <li>This shape has the general equation: </li> 
        <ul>Ax<sup>2</sup> + By<sup>2</sup> + Cz<sup>2</sup> + Dxy + Exz + Fyz + Gx + Hy + Iz + J</ul> 
   
      <br><li>The general equations and short descriptions for the basic types of quadric surfaces are as shown: </li> 
        <ul><b>Ellipsoid</b>
          <li>(x<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup>) + (y<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup>) + (z<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>) = 1</li>  
          <li>An egg-like shape</li>
        
        </ul><ul><b>Elliptical Cone</b>
          <li>(x<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup>) + (y<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup>) = (z<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)</li>
          <li>2 cones that connect at the origin and open up toward the z<sub>+</sub> & z<sub>-</sub> axis</li>
        
        </ul><ul><b>Hyperboloid of One Sheet</b>
          <li>(x<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup>) + (y<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup>) - (z<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>) = 1</li>
          <li>The cylinder-like shape that is slightly bent inwards and opens up towards the z<sub>+</sub> & z<sub>-</sub> axis</li>
        
        </ul><ul><b>Hyperboloid of 2 Sheets</b>
          <li>(z<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>) - (x<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup>) - (y<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup>) = 1</li>
          <li>2 bowls that originate from (+)c & (-)c and open up towards the z<sub>+</sub> & z<sub>-</sub> axis respectively</li>
        
         </ul><ul><b>Elliptical Paraboloid</b>
          <li>(x<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup>) + (y<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup>) = z/c</li>
          <li>A bowl that opens up towards the z<sub>+</sub> axis</li>
        
        </ul><ul><b>Hyperbolic Paraboloid</b>
          <li>(y<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup>) - (x<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup>) = z/c for c ∈ (0, ∞)</li>
          <li>A saddle-like shape made up of a parabola that opens up from the yz-plane and a parabola that opens down from the xz-plane</li>
        </ul>
    </ul> 
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 2: </b> 
      <ol>Describe the ellipsoid made by the equation {(x<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup>) + (y<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup>) + (z<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>) = 1}. 
   
        <br><br><ul>The values of a, b, & c represent the distance from the origin to the ellipsoid according to their respective axes. These values are always equal to or greater than their respective coordinates. An ellipsoid is a symmetric oval-like shape in space. If 2 values of either a, b or c are the same, the ellipsoid is known as an <b>ellipsoid of revolution</b>. If all 3 values of a, b, && c are the same, the ellipsoid is known as a <b>sphere</b>. An ellipse is extracted from the ellipsoid using the equation {(x<sup>2</sup>/(a<sup>2</sup> * (1 - (z/c)<sup>2</sup>))) + (y<sup>2</sup>/(b<sup>2</sup> * (1 - (z/c)<sup>2</sup>))) = 1}</ul> 
      </ol> 
    </ul> 
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 3: </b> 
      <ol>Describe the hyperbolic paraboloid made by the equation {(y<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup>) - (x<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup>) = z/c for c ∈ (0, ∞)}
        <ul>This shape has planes of symmetry along the yz-plane (x = 0) & xz-plane (y = 0). A cross-section of this paraboloid is a parabola and can be solved by setting either x, y, or z equal to 0. The min or max of any parabola within the paraboloid is known as a <b>saddle point</b></ul> 
      </ol> 
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 4: </b>
      <ol>Identify and describe the surface made by the equation {x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + 4z<sup>2</sup> - 2x + 4y + 1 = 0}.
        <br><br><li>A reliable way to determine the shape using the equation is by completing the square and formatting it: </li>
          <ul>(x - 1)<sup>2</sup> - 1 + (y + 2)<sup>2</sup> - 4 + 4z<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0</ul>
          <ul>(x - 1)<sup>2</sup> + (y + 2)<sup>2</sup> + 4z<sup>2</sup> - 4 = 0</ul>
          <ul class="green">((x - 1)<sup>2</sup>)/4 + ((y + 2)<sup>2</sup>)/4  + z<sup>2</sup> - 1 = 0</ul>
      
        <br><li>Based on the final equation, it can be concluded that: </li>
          <ul>The shape is an ellipsoid</ul>
          <ul>The centre of the shape is (1, -2, 0)</ul>
          <ul>The distance from the the centre of the ellipsoid and the highest length of each axis is: </ul>
            <li>sqrt(4) = 2 units along the x-axis</li>
            <li>sqrt(4) = 2 units along the y-axis</li>
            <li>sqrt(1) = 1 unit along the z-axis</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
