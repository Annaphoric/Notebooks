    <h2>Lecture 1.8: Muscular Mechanics</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Force-Velocity Relationship during Contraction</b>
    <li class="blue">Force & velocity have an inverse relationship. This higher the force, the lower the velocity (Like pushing against a wall, there is no velocity, but force is at its max)</li>
    <li>As sarcomeres are shortened isometrically, tension is created throughout the muscle providing it with strength, even if no movement by the muscle overall is done</li>
    <li>The force is dependent is on the amount of actin & myosin cross-bridges; the more cross-bridges, the stronger the force</li>
    <li class="red">The <b>velocity</b> is the rate it takes for one iteration of the cross-bridge cycle to occur</li>
      <ul>This rate is dependent on the mechanism of myosin-head ATPases</ul>
  </ul>
  
  <ul class="topic"><b>Force-Frequency Relationship during Contraction</b>
    <li>A single contraction stimulus of the muscle is known as a <b>twitch</b></li>
    <li>Repeating contraction stimuli where the tension sums up without the muscles relaxing is <b>unfused tetanus</b></li>
      <ul>This usually occurs when a muscle is stimulated to contract around every 100ms</ul>
      <ul>Even higher frequency stimuli causes <b>fused tetanus</b>
        <li>In this case, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases cannot keep up with the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions from the SR (sarcoplasmic reticulum) to the sarcoplasm (Calcium transient time)</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  
  <ul class="topic"><b>Force-Length Relationship during Contraction</b>
    <li class="blue">This relationship varies on the length and is optimal at a medial length</li>
    <li>The greatest amount of tension is produced where there is the appropriate contraction length of the sarcomere</li>
      <ul>This occurs when there is an optimal level actin-myosin interactions</ul>
      <ul>At this length, the muscle develops the greatest isometric <b>active tension</b>
        <li>This tension is made by cross-bridge linkages and occurs when delivering a force</li>
      </ul>
      
    <br><li><b>Titin</b> is the protein responsible for <b>passive tension</b> (resting tension) in muscle</li>
      <ul>This tension is not made via cross-bridge linkages and occurs during stretching exercises</ul>
  </ul>
  
  <ul class="topic"><b>Force-Calcium Relationship during Contraction</b>
    <li class="blue">This relationship is logarithimic. Force & Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels increase only at a specific [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and then will level off again</li>
    <li>Resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>intracellular</sub> â‰ˆ 10<sup>-9</sup>M</li>
    <li>Troponin requires a certain [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>intracellular</sub> before becoming active; this is the slow start at the beginning of the force-calcium graph</li>
    <li>The highest (dForce / dCalcium) slope of the tangent line is observed when [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>intracellular</sub> is around 10<sup>-6</sup>M</li>
    <li>Troponin also has a limited rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. Once [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>intracellular</sub> has reached a high enough amount, troponin becomes saturated and is no longer able to bind to the excess Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions; this is where the force-calcium graph levels off</li>
  </ul>
