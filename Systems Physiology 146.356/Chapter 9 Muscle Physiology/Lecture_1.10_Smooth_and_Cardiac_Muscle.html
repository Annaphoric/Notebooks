    <h2>Lecture 1.10: Smooth & Cardiac Muscle</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Smooth Muscle Features</b> 
      <li>Unlike skeletal & cardiac muscle, smooth muscle does not have <b>striations</b> (due to presence of A-bands & I-bands)</li>
        <ul>As a result, smooth muscle tends to be less ordered in shape & size</ul>
      <li>Individual smooth muscle cells are smaller than skeletal muscle cells</li>
      <li class="red">Smooth muscle cells only have 1 nucleus per cell unlike the other muscle cell types</li>
      <li>Smooth muscle cells are able to mitotically divide for hyperplastic growth</li>
      <li>These cells do not have troponin but interestingly, have tropomyosin for an unknown reason</li>
      <li>These types of cells are thick-filament regulated and not thin-filament regulated like in other muscle cell types</li>
        <ul>Myosin heads change shape instead of actin</ul>
      <li>Myosin ATPases have a low [rate of activity]/[velocity]</li>
      <li class="red">Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions can come from both/either the extracellular environment & the sarcoplasmic reticulum</li>
        <ul>Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are removed from the cytosol via active transport using Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases and enter the SR or extracellular space</ul>
      <li>Smooth muscle cells do not have T-tubules</li>
      <li>Action potentials in these cells are much longer, slower & variable</li>
      <li>The membrane potential is depolarised by the influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, rather than Na<sup>+</sup> ions</li>
        <ul>A stimulus can be innervation via a neuromuscular junction. This can occur spontaneously, by the binding of neurotransmitters or hormones (like Nitric oxide with causes smooth muscle relaxation), or by a change in the chemical or physical environment</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Smooth Muscle Contraction</b>
      <li>This contraction is heavily dependent on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cytosolic</sub></li>
      <ol>There are 5 major steps for/during smooth muscle contraction: 
        <li>After a stimulus that increases [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cytosolic</sub> occurs, cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions bind to and activates <b>calmodulin</b></li>
        <li>The Calcium-calmodulin complex binds to <b>myosin light-chain kinase</b> (MLCK), activating it</li>
        <li>The calmodulin-MLCK complex phosphorylates myosin head's light-chain using a P<sub>i</sub> group from ATP</li>
        <li>The phosphorylated myosin head stretches away from the myosin filament and attaches to actin via a cross-bridge linkage</li>
        <li>As long as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cytoslic</sub> remains high, myosin heads are able to phosphorylate and continue iterating through the cross-bridge cycle. When a stimulus to decrease [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cytosolic</sub> occurs, myosin light-chain phosphatases (MLCPs) remove the phosphate group from the myosin heads, drawing them away from actin (relaxation)</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Cardiac Muscle Features</b>
      <li>Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cells have sarcomeres, striations, troponin + tropomyosin, and T-tubles</li>
      <li>Like smooth muscle, cardiac muscle cells are small and only have one nucleus per cell</li>
      <li>Cardiomyocytes (cardiac muscle cells) cannot undergo tetanus because of their L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels prolonged current. This allows the duration of their action potentials to be extended via a long refractory period (200-300ms) (compared to skeletal muscle cells which have a refractory period of 1-2ms)</li>
</sup>
      <ul>This is crucial for survival since the heart must always relax to fill up with blood and pump it</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Cardiac Muscle Contraction</b>
      <ol>There are 6 major steps for/during cardiac muscle contraction: 
        <li>Pacemaker cells located in the SA node induce an action potential in cardiomyocytes, permitting the influx of Na<sup>+</sup> via voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels and depolarising the the membrane</li>
        <li>L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels within the membrane open, allowing the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the sarcoplasm</li>
        <li><b>Calcium-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release</b> (CICR) occurs. Extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions cause an intracellular cascade, opening ryanodine receptors which causes the efflux of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm</li>
        <li>The elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>intracellular</sub> allows Ca<sup>2+</sup> to migrate to the actin & myosin filaments and bind to troponin. This initiates the cross-bridge cycle</li>
        <li>Once contraction is complete, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases remove intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions by returning the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions back into the SR and/or extracellular space. Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers (antiports) also move Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the extracellular space via the influx of Na<sup>+</sup> ions</li>
        <li>Like in skeletal muscle, voltage gated K<sup>+</sup> channels open to transport K<sup>+</sup> out of the cell, causing hyperpolarisation</li>
      </ol>
        
    </ul>
