    <h2>Lecture 1.9: Muscle Fatigue & Fiber Types</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Muscle Fatigue</b> 
      <li class="blue">A decrease in the force of the muscle due to repeated work</li>
      <li>There are 2 types: </li>
        <ul><b>High Intensity Fatigue</b>
          <li class="blue">Occurs after performing subsequent high intensity workouts (HITs)</li>
          <li>Physiologically, the muscle cannot recycle/remove excess metabolites like H<sup>+</sup> (from lactic acid buildup), K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, P<sub>i</sub>, ADP and others. They build up in the muscle cell and interfere with Calcium transient time (Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, recycling, storage and others) as a result. One way this occurs is by the precipitation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by an inorganic phosphate, decreasing the total amount of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. Troponin also becomes desensitised to Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, decreasing max force. The cross-bridge linkage is directly inhibited</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Endurance Fatigue</b>
          <li class="blue">Occurs after performing a workout for an extended period of time (over 2 hours)</li>
          <li>Physiologically, the muscle lacks available oxidisable substrates such as muscle glycogen or blood glucose (not ATP). Ryanodine receptors become leaky and release excess Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to buildup in the muscle cell. This excess amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is able to activate proteases that degrade actin & myosin filaments, leading to post-workout soreness and weakness (the day after)</li>
          <li>Leads to <b>Central Fatigue</b> which is a decrease in amount of nerve impulses (APs)</li>
            <ul>Interestingly, highly motivated athletes do not experience this type of fatigue since their bodies have adjusted to perform consistent workouts/marathons</ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
   
    <ul class="topic"><b>Dimensional Relationships during Muscle Fatigue</b>
      <li><b>Force-Velocity Relationship</b></li>
        <ul>A decrease in both the maximum force & velocity occurs during fatigue. Specifically, max force is lessened once precipitation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> & P<sub>i</sub> occurs and max velocity is lessened when myosin-head ATPases (rate-determining enzymes) become disrupted</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Force-Calcium Relationship</b></li>
        <ul>A decrease in the peak force and and calcium sensitivity occurs during fatigue. At a given force, a fatigued muscle fiber requires more Ca<sup>2+</sup> than a normal fiber; at a given Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, a fatigued fiber delivers less force than a normal fiber</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Muscle Fiber Types</b>
      <li class="blue">Fiber types are classified by their average velocity (iteration rate of [cross-bridge cycle]/[contraction]) and how they make ATP</li>
      <li>There are 3 common types of muscle fibers as shown in the following table: </li>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td></td><th>Type I</th><th>Type II-a</th><th>Type II-x</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Velocity</th><td>Slow</td><td>Intermediate</td><td>Fast</td>  
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Myosin-Head ATPase Activity</th><td>Slow</td><td>Intermediate</td><td>Fast</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Source of ATP</th><td>Oxidative Phosphorylation</td><td>Oxidative Phosphorylation</td><td>Glycolysis</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Relative Amount of Mitochondria</th><td>Abundant</td><td>Several</td><td>Limited</td>  
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Relative Amount of Capillaries</th><td>Abundant</td><td>Abundant</td><td>Limited</td>  
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Relative Amount of Myoglobin</th><td>Abundant</td><td>Somewhat abundant</td><td>Limited</td>  
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Colour (Due to Amount of Myoglobin)</th><td>Red</td><td>Pink</td><td>White</td>  
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Rate of Fatigue</th><td>Slow (>1 hour)</td><td>Intermediate (≈1 hour)</td><td>Fast (≈5 minutes)</td> 
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Glycogen Content</th><td>Limited</td><td>Somewhat abundant</td><td>Abundant</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Average Fiber Diameter</th><td>Small</td><td>Large</td><td>Large</td>  
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Size of Motor Neuron</th><td>Small</td><td>Intermediate</td><td>Large</td>  
          </tr>
        </table>
  
      <br><li>A fiber type I & type II cannot be interconverted between one another because of the large difference in myosin ATPase structure. Although, a fiber type II-a & type II-x can, in fact, be interconverted with the other. Fiber type II-a's are converted to fiber type II-x's via frequent power & strength training. Fiber II-x's are converted to fiber type II-a's via frequent endurance training</li> 
      <li>Genetics plays a large role in percentage of fiber type composition</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Dimensional Relationships based of Muscle Fiber Types</b> 
      <li>As long as the fiber diameter remains constant, type I and type II fibers both generally produce the same force for a given [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]</li>
      <li>The max velocity of type II-x fibers is higher than that of type I fibers</li> 
      <li>Type II-x fibers respond quicker (higher cooperativity) to an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> than type I which have a more gradual increase in force relative to the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Motor Units</b>
      <li class="blue">A <b>motor unit</b> includes the α-motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers it innervates (synapses with)</li>
        <ul>A single motor unit can only have and innervate one type of muscle fiber</ul>
      <li>Type II-x motor units have a higher total amount of total fibers than type I motor units</li>
        <ul>For this reason, motor unit type II-x's provide much greater tension force than any other motor unit type</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Recruitment Principle</b></li>
        <ul>Once a force is initiated, motor units are always recruited in the order: type I, type II-a's, type II-x's</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Effects of Aging on Muscle</b>
      <li>Research has shown that the muscle's max force declines by 30%-40% between the ages of 30-80</li>
        <ul>Specifically, fast fibers are degraded as age increases</ul>
        <ul>The degree of this effect can be lessened by performing strength training exercises</ul>
    </ul>
