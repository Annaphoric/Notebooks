    <h2>Lecture 1.7: Skeletal Muscle Contraction</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>EC Coupling</b>
      <ol>There are 4 steps that make up this process: 
        <li>An AP is initiated by the sum of end plate potentials and propagates down the <b>sarcoplasmic membrane</b> (muscle membrane not part of the end plate and contains voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels) and into the <b>T-tubules</b> (invaginations of the sarcoplasmic membrane)</li>
        <li>The depolarisation of the T-tubule causes <b>DHP receptors</b> (dihydropyridine receptors) located on the T-tubular membrane to open their attached <b>ryanodine receptor</b> (a voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux channel)</li>
        <li>Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions exit the <b>sarcoplasmic reticula</b> (smooth endoplasmic reticula of the muscle cell located near the T-tubule) and enter the sarcoplasm (muscle cell cytoplasm)</li>
        <li>These Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions travel towards the A-band and bind to troponin, preparing the muscle cell for contraction</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>[Contraction]/[Cross-Bridge Cycling]/[Sliding Filament Theory]</b>
      <ol>There are 4 steps that occur in one iteration of the cycle:
        <li>The [myosin-head]-[ADP]-[P<sub>i</sub>] energised cross-bridge complex binds to actin</li>
        <li>ADP + P<sub>i</sub> are released from the myosin head, causing a <b>power stroke</b> (the bending of the myosin-head, eliciting a force)</li>
        <li>ATP, if available, binds to the myosin-head, dissociating it from the actin filament (relaxation). If ATP is not available, the myosin-head will remain bent (contracted) and causes a condition known as <b>rigor mortis</b> (the stiffening of skeletal muscles; usually seen a few hours after death)</li>
        <li>The myosin-head ATPase domain hydrolyses ATP into ADP + P<sub>i</sub> (this is the [rate-determining]/[slow] step) and re-energises the cross-bridge linkage. If Ca<sup>2+</sup> is still available, return to step 1</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Muscle relaxation</b>
      <li>There are several events that occur during muscle relaxation: </li>
        <ul>The AP ceases or does not occur</ul>
        <ul>Acetylcholine esterase breaks down acetylcholine into an acetic acid & choline</ul>
        <ul>The flow of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum stops</ul>
        <ul>Troponin no longer has a bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion and is deactivated</ul>
        <ul>Myosin-binding sites on the actin filament are blocked by tropomyosin</ul>
        <ul>Circa pumps (Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase pumps) recycle Ca<sup>2+</sup> back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This step occurs at a slower rate than the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the sarcoplasm</ul>
      <li><b>Calcium transient time</b> is the amount of time it takes for Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to move from/to different regions of the muscle cell</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Drugs that Poison Neuromuscular Junction Events</b>
      <li>Some of these poisons include: </li>
        <ul>Organophosphates
          <li>A common ingredient in insecticides that blocks acetylcholine esterase, forcing nicotinic receptors to stay open and inactivates voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Insects that ingest this poison die by contraction paralysis</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Vecuronium
          <li>A paralytic agent used during surgery to calm muscles, including the diaphragm. This helps cardiothoracic surgeons have better accuracy since the chest isn't constantly inflating & deflating. The patient must be artificially ventilated to maintain air circulation during the procedure</li>
          <li>Functions as an acetylcholine antagonist, which prohibits acetylcholine from binding to nicotinic receptors</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
