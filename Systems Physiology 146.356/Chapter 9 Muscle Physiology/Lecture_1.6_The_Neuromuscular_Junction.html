    <h2>Lecture 1.6: The Neuromuscular Junction</h2>
  
  <ul class="topic"><b>Muscle Tissue</b>
    <li>Muscle is one of the 4 types of tissue (Epithelial, Connective & Nervous are the others)</li>
    <li>Muscle cells are able to store Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions within its sarcoplasmic reticulum, even when extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are normally higher outside the cell</li>
    <li><b>Muscle Anatomy</b></li>
      <ul>Muscle tissue is arranged within tendons that work alongside connective tissue. Skeletal muscle cells are long <b>muscle fibers</b> containing many <b>myofibrils</b>. Myofibrils are made up of many <b>sarcomeres</b> which are the main functional units of a skeletal muscle cell. Sarcomeres have multiple defined lines that show where they begin, end and their relevant points. Every sarcomere is bordered between 2 Z lines and has an M-line in the centre. The sarcomere also labels the different regions known as the H-zone, I-band & A-band depending on if actin and/or myosin filaments are present. The H-zone tells the location where actin filaments are not present, only myosin filaments. The I-band tells the location where myosin filaments are not present, only actin filaments. The A-band tells the location where both actin & myosin filaments are present. The M-line is within the H-zone & A-band and the Z-line is within the I-band</ul>
  </ul>
  
  <ul class="topic"><b>Muscle Relaxation/Contraction</b>
    <li>There are 4 main proteins, ATP and a few ions that are involved in muscle contraction</li>
    <li>The 2 contractile proteins are: </li>
      <ul><b>Actin</b>
        <li>A type of microfilament also known as a thin filament</li>
      </ul>
      <ul><b>Myosin</b>
        <li>A type of filament also known as a thick filament</li>
        <li>Contains light chains near the head and heavy chains as the tail</li>
        <li>Acts as a receptor that binds to ATP</li>
      </ul>
    <li>The 2 Regulatory Proteins are: </li>
      <ul><b>Troponin</b>
        <li>A globular protein always bound to actin & tropomyosin</li>
        <li>Acts as a receptor that binds to Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions</li>
      </ul>
      <ul><b>Tropomyosin</b>
        <li>A type of filament always bound to troponin & actin</li>
      </ul>
      
    <br><li>During relaxation: </li>
      <ul>Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are not present near the filaments</ul>
      <ul>Troponin does not move tropomyosin off of the myosin-binding sites on actin (thin filament regulation)</ul>
      <ul>Actin cannot bind to myosin heads/beads</ul>
      <ul>ATP is bound to myosin heads, separating them from actin</ul>
    
    <br><li>During contraction: </li>
      <ul>Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are bound to troponin</ul>
      <ul>Troponin moves tropomyosin off of the myosin-binding sites of actin (thin filament regulation)</ul>
      <ul>Actin binds myosin heads/beads, forming a cross-bridge linkage</ul>
      <ul>ADP + P<sub>i</sub> or nothing is bound to myosin heads, causing contraction</ul>
  </ul>
  
  <ul class="topic"><b>Muscle Transduction during Contraction</b>
    <li>There are 3 major steps that are part of the transduction for muscle movement: </li>
      <ul><b>Excitation</b>
        <ol>There are 5 steps that occur for/during excitation: 
          <li>An AP propagates down an <b>α-motor neuron</b>. This is the neuron that synapses with a muscle cell</li>
          <li>Voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels located on the pre-synaptic terminal of the α-motor neuron open</li>
          <li>Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions enter the α-motor neuron and the excitatory neurotransmitter <b>acetylcholine</b> (ACh) is released into the <b>neuromuscular junction</b> (synaptic cleft of neuron & muscle cell) from vesicles within the pre-synaptic terminal</li>
          <li>2 Acetylcholine molecules bind to ionotropic <b>nicotinic receptors</b> on the end plate (muscle cell membrane involved in neuromuscular synapse), allowing Na<sup>+</sup> ions to enter the muscle cell and K<sup>+</sup> ions to leave the muscle cell. Na<sup>+</sup> ions entering the cell have a greater effect than K<sup>+</sup> ions leaving the cell, causing end plate to become slightly depolarised</li>
          <li>An <b>end plate potential</b> (a type of local potential) occurs</li>
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <ul><b>EC coupling</b></ul>
      <ul><b>Contraction</b></ul>
  </ul>
