    <h2>Lecture 3.13: Female Reproductive System Continued</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Monthly Reproductive Cycle</b>
      <li>There are 3 significant phases in the female reproductive cycle of 28 days: </li>
        <ul>Days 1-7: 
          <li>Day 1 is defined as the first day of <b>menstruation</b> which last 5-7 days. During menstruation, the endometrial lining of the uterus begins to degenerate, causing bleeding</li>
          <li>These 7 days make up the first half of the <b>Follicular Phase</b>. In this phase, several follicles are maturing & beginning to secrete estrogen. Eventually, one follicle becomes most dominant having the most FSH & LH receptors (most stimulation of Granulosa & Theca cells)</li>
          <li>FSH levels slowly increase and LH levels remain somewhat constant whilst estrogen levels remain relatively low and progesterone is nearly zero. Since estrogen is low, there are little negative feedback effects on FSH</li>
          <li>At the end of the 7th day, estrogen levels increase slightly</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul>Days 8-14: 
          <li>These 7 days make up the second half of the Follicular Phase. The one follicle that is chosen is released into the fallopian tube via <b>ovulation</b>. During ovulation, the oocyte within the follicle undergoes the first meiotic division, breaks free from the surrounding follicular cells and travels into the fallopian tube, leaving behind the corpus luteum. This marks the end of the Follicular Phase</li>
          <li>Estrogen increases greatly, while FSH decreases slightly due to the atresia (cell death; degeneration) of non-dominant follicles. Unlike normal conditions, the increased plasma estrogen induces positive feedback onto FSH & LH. About 18 hours before ovulation (on day 14), LH levels dramatically increase and FSH levels slightly increase. The LH surge induces ovulation. Ovulation is also mediated by follicular enzymes & prostaglandins</li>
          <li>The endometrial lining of the uterus begins to proliferate and thicken due to the increase of estrogen; this is also why these days are referred to as the Proliferative Phase</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul>Days 15-28: 
          <li>These 2 weeks mark the <b>Luteal Phase</b> or the Secretory Phase. The corpus luteum secretes inhibin and large amounts of estrogen & progesterone. Estrogen & progesterone induce negative feedback effects on FSH & LH via pulsatile secretions of GnRH to prevent another oocyte/egg from being released or new primary follicles from forming. The endometrium becomes rich in glycogen & glycoproteins to prepare for a potential zygote</li>
          <li>LH levels decrease dramatically to normal levels and slowly decrease. Although, there is enough LH to maintain the corpus luteum until around the end of the Luteal Phase</li>
          <li>On around day 18, granulosa cells from the corpus luteum cease the release of estrogen then continue the release again on around day 21</li>
          <li>After about day 25, the corpus luteum degrades, decreasing estrogen & progesterone levels to normal levels. Without the negative feedack effects on GnRH, FSH & LH levels begin to rise once again. The absence of high amounts of estrogen & progesterone causes the endometrium to slowly shed, leading up to day 1, the first day of menstruation</li>
          <li>The last week of the cycle will take a slightly different route if fertilisation does occur. This will be further discussed in the next lecture</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>Taking oral contraceptives or "the pill" maintains high levels of estrogen & progesterone, inhibiting FSH & LH and preventing another follicle from developing and therefore ovulation from occurring</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Choosing the Right Time For Pregnancy</b>
      <li>Once the egg is released into the fallopian tube (ovulation occurs), the egg is only viable for about 48 hours. After this time, it will degrade</li>
      
      <br><li>Ovulation tests measure the amount of LH secreted/excreted. The LH surge is an indication that ovulation will occur in 18 hours; this lets the prospective mother know that the chance to become pregnant will be likely within the next few days</li>
      
      <br><li>As for the prospective father, a typical ejaculation releases around 150 million sperm, but only about 1-200 sperm cells manage to find their way into the fallopian tube. Obstacles include the acidity of the vagina, the length of the trip and the direction of where the egg lies. Sperm can last up 5 days in the reproductive tract</li>
      <li>If the remaining sperm cells manage to find the egg, they must bind to the zona pellucida that surrounds the egg cell. The first one that binds to the zona pellucida fertilises the egg, forming the zygote. An acrosomal reaction of a wave of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions & oocytic enzymes prevent other sperm from binding to the zona pellucida</li>
      
      <br><li>Once the egg is fertilised, it completes the second meiotic division and the zygote begins embryogenesis</li>
    </ul>
