    <h2>Lecture 3.11: Introduction & Male Reproductive System</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Spermatogenesis & Oogenesis</b>
      <li>Both processes occur in the gonads via meiosis</li>
      
      <br><li><b>Spermatogenesis</b></li>
        <ul>Occurs in the testes in males</ul>
        <ul>Begins at the onset of puberty</ul>
        <ul>Takes about 70 days to complete one cycle of sperm cell formation</ul>
        <ul>A primary spermatocyte (diploid; n = 46) undergoes the first meiotic division to form 2 secondary spermatocytes (haploid; n = 23)</ul>
        <ul>Each secondary spermatocyte undergoes a second meiotic division to form 4 spermatids in total (remains haploid)</ul>
        <ul>Spermatids then mature into active sperm cells</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Oogenesis</b></li>
        <ul>Occurs in the ovaries in females</ul>
        <ul>Primary oocytes form in utero (during fetal development)</ul>
        <ul>Secondary oocytes form between the periods of puberty to menopause, but some may form before puberty</ul>
        <ul>A primary oocyte (diploid) undergoes the first meiotic division to form 2 secondary oocytes (haploid). One secondary oocyte is much smaller in volume and becomes the first polar body which degrades. The other secondary oocyte is much larger in volume</ul>
        <ul>As the remaining secondary ooctyte begins a second meiotic division, it is arrested at metaphase until it is fertilised by a sperm cell. If ferilisation occurs, the secondary oocyte will divide to form a smaller secondary polar body & a larger oocyte or egg cell. The egg cell and sperm cell (both haploid) unite to form a diploid zygote. Otherwise, the oocyte breaks down</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Sex Determination & Differentiation</b>
      <li>Sex is biologically determined once fertilisation occurs. An individual normally obtains an X-chromosome from the mother and an X or Y-chromosome from the father</li>
      
      <br><li>There are rare cases where nondisjunction occurs and an zygote will have an abnormal set of sex chromosomes like XXX (triple-X syndrome), XXY, XO (Turner's Syndrome). There are also cases where an individual with XX-chromosomes is not expressed as a females and an individual with XY-chromosomes is not expressed as a male. The default case for human growth is female</li>
      
      <br><li>In the case for normal individuals with an XY-chromosome: </li>
        <ul>At the 7th-8th week of gestation, the SRY-gene of a Y-chromosome is expressed. The expression of this gene gives a male his male characteristics (via transcription factors), like testes formation (primary sex characteristic). During the formation of the testes in the fetus, Sertoli cells release <b>Anti-Mullerian Hormone</b>. This hormone induces the degeneration of the Mullerian (ovarian) ducts, preventing an individual with XY-chromosome set from remaining a female. It also stimulates the growth of the Wolffian duct which becomes the epididymis, vas deferens, ejaculatory duct & the seminal vesicles (secondary sex characteristics). These characteristics are induced by <b>Leydig cells</b> which produce testosterone</ul>
        <ul>Later on in development, <b>Dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT; a derivative of testosterone) stimulates the production of further secondary sex characteristics like the penis, scrotum and descent of testes</ul>
      
      <br><li>In the case for normal individuals with an XX-chromosome: </li>
        <ul>At the 8th-9th week of gestation, with the absence of the Y-chromosome & SRY-gene the Wolffian ducts degenerate and the Mullerian duct further matures, forming the uterus and fallopian tubes (primary sex chacteristics)</ul>
        <ul>Later on in development, the outer vagina & other external female genitalia form (secondary sex )</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Sex Differentiation Disorders</b>
      <li>These types of disorders include: </li>
        <ul><b>Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome</b>
          <li>The lack of stimulation to form male characterstics even though the individual's chromosomes are XY. This individual would present with internal testes & external female genitalia. Since there is no duct system, this disorder is usually not detected until around the time that puberty should occur. The lack of a menstrual cycle is the indication of this syndrome</li>
          <li>These individuals are not able to respond to testosterone (malfunctioning receptors); so they do not develop as a male but do not fully develop as a female since the SRY gene is still being expressed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul>Abnormal Gene Expression
          <li>Early life experiences like environmental factors play a role in the gene expression in sex chromosomes. This introduces the field of <b>epigenetics</b> which is the degree of expression in certain genes, whether inducing or repressing</li>
          <li>Maternal malnutrition, premature birth can lead to a change in epigenetics via DNA methylation or histone modifications</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Male Reproductive System</b>
      <li>The <b>scrotum</b> houses the testes where spermatogenesis occurs. Specifically, the <b>seminiferous tubules</b> are the site where meiosis occurs to form sperm cells. These seminiferous tubules originate closer to the <b>epididymis</b> which diverge from it. The epididymis is the site of sperm maturation. During ejaculation, sperm exit the epididymis and travel along the vas deferens to eventually reach the urethra for release. It is shown that about 10% of contents in semen are sperm cells</li>
      
      <br><li>As the sperm travels along the vas deferens, it reaches the <b>seminal vesicles</b>. These bulb-like vesicles secrete chemicals to promote sperm motility & fructose to nourish the sperm cells, forming semen. It is shown that 60% of contents in semen are seminal vesicular fluids</li>
      
      <br><li>Sperm also passes through the <b>prostate gland</b> which is located right below the bladder and near the urethra. Enlargement of the prostate gland occurs in 90% of all males, especially after the age of 50. Symptoms of this include frequent urination. The prostate gland secretes HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions to buffer the acidity of the vagina, protecting plenty of sperm from being killed on their way to the egg. It is shown that 30% of contents in semen are prostatic fluids</li>
      
      <br><li>The final relevant gland that the sperm encounters on its way to be excreted is the <b>bulbourethral gland</b>. The purpose of this gland is to buffer the residual urine that remains in the urethra, protecting the sperm from being killed on their way to excretion. They also have a lubricating role. It is shown that less than 1% of contents in semen are from bulbourethral fluids</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Sperm Transport, Ejaculation, & Erectile Dysfunction</b>
      <li>Sperm and semen are stored in the <b>vas deferens</b> which is the long tube where the sperm travels to be excreted. Within seminiferous tubules, Sertoli cells create a hydrostatic pressure gradient by secreting fluid into the tubules. This induces the secretion and push of the semen towards excretion</li>
      
      <br><li>An erection and ejaculation occurs via a combination of parasympathetic & sympathetic drives. Parasympathetic drives focus mainly on the ability to have an erection whilst sympathetic drive focuses more on the ability to ejaculate</li>
        <ul>Vasodilation along the penis stimulated via parasympathetic drive is mediated by Nitrous oxide (NO). NO is a hormone that travels to smooth muscle cells of arteries within the penis. NO activates guanylyl cyclase which catalyses the conversion of GTP into cGMP</ul>
      
      
      <br><li><b>Erectile Dysfunction</b></li>
        <ul>Studies show that about 10% or more adult males, usually above the age of 40, suffer from erectile dysfunction</ul>
        <ul>Causes may include stress, psychological factors, diabetes, obesity and/or alcohol consumption</ul>
        <ul>Treatments are cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors like Viagra & Sildenafil
          <li>Normally, cGMP phosphodiesterases remove the phosphate group from cGMP, deactivating it and blocks vasodilation. Viagra acts like a competitive inhibitor by binding to cGMP phosphodiesterase's active site, allowing more cGMP to concentrate within a photoreceptor cell. Like what occurs in the dark, more cGMP increases the influx of non-selective cation channels, depolarising the cell</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
