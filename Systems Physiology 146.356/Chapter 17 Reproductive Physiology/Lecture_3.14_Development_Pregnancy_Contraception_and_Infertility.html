    <h2>Lecture 3.14: Development, Pregnancy, Contraception & Infertility</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Early Development</b>
      <li>Once fertilisation has occurred, the egg & sperm form a <b>zygote</b> (conceptus). The zygote remains in the fallopian tube for 3-4 days. Short contractions of the uterus promote slow movement of the zygote towards the uterus. As it moves towards the uterus, it undergoes mitotic divisions (cleavages) to form the blastomeres (2 cells), blastula (4 cells), gastrula (8 cells), morula and so on</li>
      <li>By the time the zygote reaches the uterus, the gastrula is made up of 16-32 <b>totipotent stem cells</b>, which are able to differentiate to any cell under the right conditions. Identical twins can form at this point in time</li>
      <li>After about a week of divisions (Days 14-21 of the monthly cycle), there are about 100 cells present and the body of cells is known as the <b>blastocyst</b>. A blastocyst has an inner cell mass & an outer cell layer known as the <b>trophoblast</b>. Differentiation occurs at this point: the inner cell mass becomes the embryo and fetus whilst the trophoblast becomes the support structures like the umbilical cord, the amniotic sac & the placenta</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul><b>Implantation & Placenta Development</b>
      <li>The blastocyst must be implanted on the surface of the uterus (endometrium) in order for the pregnancy to be viable. If becomes implanted too early (within the fallopian tube), a tubal pregnancy occurs which results in a miscarriage</li>
      
      <br><li>Once implantation has occurred, the trophoblast of the blastocyst invades (spreads into) the endometrial cells of the uterus. Paracrine or local signaling occurs here via the endometrial cells to temporarily nourish the embryo. Nutrients like glycogen & oxygen are given to the embryo</li>
      
      <br><li>After about 5 weeks of implantation (8 weeks of "pregnancy"), the placenta takes over to nourish the embryo in the long-term. Fetal & maternal tissues interlock wwith each other to ensure nourishment</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Pregnancy</b>
      <br><li>Day 1 of pregnancy is considered to be the first day of the last period. Day 14 of pregnancy is when ovulation occurs. Day 21 of pregnancy is the formation of the blastocyst</li>
      
      <br><li>During pregnancy, FSH levels must remain low to prevent another follicle from forming. This ensures that the current fetus being nourished is the only body present within the mother. Continuous secretion of estrogen & progesterone induce negative feedback effects on FSH</li>
      
      <br><li>A pregnancy test measures the amount of <b>human chorionic gonadotropin</b> (hCG) excreted. hCG is secreted by the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst to promote the perisistence of the corpus luteum. Levels of hCG surge 1-3 months after the last period or 2-10 weeks after fertilisation</li>
      
      <br><li>Progesterone levels during pregnancy are also high to prevent uterine contracts and allow the baby to become properly nourished</li>
      <li>Estrogen stimulates growth of the uterine muscle</li>
      <li>Both progesterone & estrogen are continuously secreted by the corpus luteum for 2 months of pregnancy. After 2 months, the placenta takes over to secrete estrogen & progesterone</li>
      
      <br><li>In the first trimester, morning sickness like nausea is likely to occur. About 2/3 of pregnant women have undergone morning sickness. This may be due to the high levels of hCG, but this still remains an area for research</li>
      <li>Most organ development of the fetus also occurs within the first trimester whilst the 2nd trimester focuses on the organ growth</li>
      
      <br><li>As for the mother, metabolism in every bodily system generally increases. Examples include increased prolactin, ADH, aldosterone, renin, erythropoietin, breast size, body weight, appetite, thirst, blood volume, bone turnover rate, cardiac output, and hyperventilation</li>
      
      <br><li>Starting from about 30 weeks preganant and onward, practice contractions or "Braxton Hicks" occur to prepare the mother for delivery</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Parturition</b>
      <li class="blue">Also referred to as giving birth</li>
      
      <br><li>Within the last few weeks of pregnancy, there is synthesis of the <b>connexin</b> (the protein that links cells in contact with each other via gap junctions) between <b>myometrial cells</b> (the cells between the muscle cells & the uterus) to allow for coordinated uterine contractions. The contractions must be stron and rhythmic to push the baby out</li>
        <ul>There is also a large increase in oxytocin receptors on the myometrium. These receptors are mediated by estrogen & progesterone which reach very high levels slightly before parturition</ul>
      <li>The cervix will also become more mellow & flexible to promote the movement of the baby out of the mother</li>
      
      <br><li>Uterine contactions during parturition initiate at the upper uterus & sweep downwards towards the cervix. This forces the cervix to dilate. The cervix must be dilated at least 10cm to prevent tearing of the uterine muscles</li>
      
      <br><li>C-sections are becoming more common nowadays. Mothers who have undergone a C-section the first time are recommended to undergo C-sections for subsequent times</li>
      <li>Although, research shows vaginal births have more benefits to the infant than via C-sections. This is because vaginal births expose the infant to certain microbiota that benefits the baby's growth overall. There is also a strong correlation between having no asthma & allergy issues and vaginal births</li>
      
      <br><li>Studies show that only 10% of women initiate labor with the rupture of their amniotic sac (water breaking)</li>
      
      <li><b>Pitocin</b> (a synthetic derivative of oxytocin) stimulates labor to occur. It can be given to a pregnant woman who is already 9 months pregnant to stimulate labor if she has not undergone it</li> 
        <ul>Interestingly, what actually induces labor naturally is unknown. Speculations indicate that the uterus or fetus releases prostaglandins to promote oxytocin release</ul>
      
      <br><li>The baby must be faced downwards (towards the mother's posterior) with its head towards the cervix in order to properly remove the baby via vaginal birth. If the baby is facing another direction, a C-section would be required to remove the baby</li>
      
      <br><li>After parturition, the mother must also push out the placenta and surrender it to the ob-gyn</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Amenorrhea</b>
      <li class="blue">The lack of a menstrual cycle (no shedding of the endometrium; no period) for 3 months or longer</li>
      
      <br><li>This normally occurs in the case of pregnancy, but may occur if there is are hormone abnormalities, thyroid issues, stress (increased cortisol), low body weight/fat (or even anorexia, malnutrition). Since having a period increases plasma estrogen, the lack of a period indicates low estrogen which can lead to bone degradation & muscle weakness</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Lactation</b>
      <li class="blue">The secretion of milk from the mothers breasts</li>
      
      <br><li><b>Prolactin-releasing factor</b> (PRF) promotes the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland. Prolactin then binds to receptors in mammary gland cells, stimulating them to produce breastmilk</li>
        <ul>Prolactin is also stimulated by the decrease in estrogen levels, since the placenta is no longer within the mother (the placenta secreted the estrogen)</ul>
        <ul>Dopamine demotes the release of prolactin</ul>
        
      <br><li>Oxytocin promotes milk ejection by binding to receptors on myoepithelial cells within the breast. These muscle cells contract, forcing milk to be ejected when stimulated</li>
        <ul>The suckling of the infant promotes an increase in both prolactin & oxytocin</ul>
        
      <br><li>Prolactin has a negative feedback effect on GnRH. This reduces the chance of ovulation and therefore limits another pregnancy from occurring while the mother is nursing her current infant. Although, there are many cases where a recent mother can become pregnant again despite nursing a current infant</li>
      
      <br><li>When nursing, the clear fluid known as <b>colostrum</b> is secreted from the breast. Colostrum is very rich in nutrients & antibodies. A few days following colostrum secretion, the mother's breastmilk has a more milky appearance</li>
      
      <br><li>The mother should be relaxed while the baby is latched onto the nipple in order for breastmilk to be properly ejected</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Contraception</b>
      <li class="blue">Methods to prevent unwanted pregnancy</li>
      
      <br><li>To prevent sperm cells from entering the uterus, condoms, cervical caps or cervical sponges can be used</li>
        <ul>There is a 9-23% failure rate using this method</ul>
      
      <br><li>To kill sperm cells within the vagina after insemination, spermicides can be used in females</li>
        <ul>There is a 20-50% failure rate using this method</ul>
        
      <br><li>To prevent sperm from being present in seminal fluid, a vasectomy is performed in males. To prevent sperm from reaching the egg, a tubal ligation is performed in females</li>
        <ul>Both methods have less than a 0.5% failure rate</ul>
        
      <br><li>To prevent the implantation of the blastocyst, an intrauterine device (IUD) can be used in females</li>
        <ul>There is less than a 3% failure rate using this method</ul>
      
      <br><li>To prevent ovulation, suppress LH levels, thicken cervical mucus (preventing sperm entry into the uterus), and/or alter endometrium (preventing implantation), females can take estrogens and/or progestins via oral contraceptive pills (having a 3% failure rate), emergency oral contraction (having a 1% failure rate), injectible or implantable progestins (having less than a 0.5% failure rate), transdermal patches (having a 1-2% failure rate), or a vaginal ring (having less than a 1% failure rate)</li>
      
      <br><li>Abstinence or not having sex is the only method with a 0% failure rate</li>
      
      <br><li>Only condoms are effective in preventing STIs</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Infertility</b>
      <li>Studies show that 1 in 10 couples experience <b>infertility</b> issues (the inability for the female to become pregnant even after a year of trying every month)</li>
      
      <br><li>A reason for infertility may be because of the male (one out of 4 times)</li>
        <ul>This may be due to low sperm count or motility</ul>
      
      <br><li>Another reason for infertility may because of the female (half of the times)</li>
        <ul>This may be due to ovulation issues, oocyte immobility or zygote malformation</ul>
      
      <br><li>The other one out of 4 times of infertility is due to unknown causes</li>
      
      <br><li><b>In vitro fertilisation</b> is the formation of a zygote outside of a mother's womb</li>
        <ul> The female receives estrogen injections to promote egg production. Once the egg is released, it is placed in a dish containing the prospective father's sperm. Once the zygote becomes a gastrula, it is transferred into the female's uterus for continued development</ul>
        <ul>Due to financial reasons, this option is limited (can cost about $12000 per attempt, not including hormone injections)</ul>
        
      <br><li>In utero insemination can also be performed to induce fertilisation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Miscarriages</b>
      <li>Also referred to as spontaneous abortion</li>
      
      <br><li>About 1 in 3 pregnancies result in miscarriages. Most of them occur before even the prospective mother realises that she was even pregnant</li>
      
      <br><li>Most miscarriages occur because of chromosomal abnormalities like nondisjunction during meiosis (Over 50% of the time). They can also occur due to abnormal implantation or placenta development</li>
      
      <br><li>Prospective parents should realise that miscarriages are no one's fault, but simply just a case of bad luck. As long as the parents are determined and persistent, using all the knowledge and resources that they have on the subject, pregnancy can occur as wanted</li>
    </ul>
