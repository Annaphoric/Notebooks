    <h2>Lecture 3.12: HPG Axis & Female Reproductive System</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Gonad Axis</b>
      <li class="blue">The HPG Axis is the control of reproduction via hormones released in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, & gonads</li>
      
      <br><li>In males: </li>
        <ul><b>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone</b> (GnRH) is secreted by the hypothalamus (this occurs every 90min). This hormone stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release the gonadotropins <b>follicle-stimulating hormone</b> (FSH) & <b>luteinising hormone</b> (LSH). Both FSH & LH target the testes and stimulate 2 different types of cells:
          <li><b>Sertoli cells</b> (Cystintacular cells) are stimulated by FSH. Sertoli cells promote spermatogenesis & <b>inhibin</b> release. Inhibin exerts negative feedback on FSH, reducing its secretion</li>
          
          <br><li><b>Leydig cells</b> (Interstitial cells) are stimulated by LH. Leydig cells secrete <b>testosterone</b> (a steroid) and its derivatives. One function of testosterone is to induce local positive feedback for Sertoli cells, further stimulating them. Testosterone also has negative feedback effects on LH & GnRH</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul>Overall, the concentrations of all hormones do not change dramatically. Although, testosterone has a circadian rhythm where it is stimulated most in the morning. Testosterone release is also affected by age & BMI. Higher age & BMI is correlated with lower testosterone</ul>
        <ul>Other effects of testosterone include: 
          <li>Promotes the initiation & maintenance of spermatogenesis</li>
          <li>Promotes secondary sex characteristics like body hair, deeper voice, further muscle growth</li>
          <li>Demotes the action of estrogen on breast growth</li>
          <li>Promotes bone growth & overall protein anabolism</li>
          <li>Promotes sex drive & aggressive behaviour, per se</li>
          <li>Promotes erythropoetin secretion in the kidneys, increasing O<sub>2</sub> utilisation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul>Use of synthetic steroids like testosterone may cause the overstimulation and enlargement of prostate tissue, aggression, decreased testicular size, decreased spermatogenesis, low sperm count and male infertility as a result</ul>
      
      <br><li>In females: </li>
        <ul>Like in males, GnRH is secreted by the hypothalamus and stimulates the release of FSH & LH from the anterior pituitary gland. These 2 hormones target the ovaries to stimulate 2 types of cells: 
          <li><b>Granulosa cells</b> are stimulated by FSH. These cells promote oogenesis, oocyte maturation, inhibin release & androgen-converting enzymes. Like in males, inhibin induces negative feedback effects on FSH</li>
          
          <br><li><b>Theca cells</b> are stimulated by LH. These cells secrete androgens which are then converted to estrogens via androgen-converting enzymes. One function of estrogen is to induce a local positive feedback for granulosa cells to produce more androgen-converting enzyme. Estrogen has exerts negative feedback effects on LH & GnRH</li>
          
          <br><li>Other effects of estrogen include female secondary sex characteristics like breast growth, widening of hips and soft skin</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Reproductive Cycles in Females</b>
      <li>There are 2 main cycles for the hormone release which will be discussed in greater detail later on: </li>
          <ul><b>Ovarian Cycle</b>
            <li>The cycle consisting of the changes that occur in the ovaries within one month (28 days)</li>
            <li>In this cycle, the strongest, most resistant egg is released for possible fertilisation</li>
            <li>The occyte is released on day 14 and the corpus luteum remains until the beginning of the menstrual cycle</li>
            <li>The uterus also prepares for possible fertilisation by acting as a house for a zygote</li>
          </ul>
          
          <br><ul><b>Menstrual Cycle</b>
            <li>The cycle consisting of the changes that occur in the uterus within one month (28 days)</li>
            <li>Day 1 is considered to be first day of bleeding</li>
          </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Female Reproductive System</b>
      <li>The 2 <b>ovaries</b> are located at the ends of each <b>fallopian tube</b> (uterine tubes; generally oviducts in mammals) and connected directly to the uterus. The fallopian tubes contain <b>fimbrae</b> (small finger-like projections) at the ends which guide the ovulated egg into the tube. The <b>cervix</b> is an opening located at the deepest region of the vagina. It is the most inferior portion of the uterus. The <b>uterus</b> is a muscular pouch that houses a potential fetus. It is normally the size of a pear but can expand up to the size of a basketball!</li>
      
      <br><li>As long as a female is within her reproductive years (around ages 13-50) and not on oral contraceptives, she is always working to make a baby. Starting from birth, a female produces 2-4 million eggs but ovulates only about 400 in her lifetime. Due to the limited amount of eggs, the strongest eggs are chosen to ovulate first while the less potent (older) eggs ovulate over the years. This implies that older eggs are more prone to chromosomal abonormalites and possible miscarriages</li>
      
      <br><li>A <b>primary follicle</b> is made up of the oocyte surrounded by the <b>zona pellucida</b> (a clear fluid) which is also surrounded by a one-cell thick layer of granulosa cells</li>
      <li>Some primary follicles become <b>early antral follicles</b> which have the same properties as a primary follicle, except the granulosa layer becomes thicker and there is the addition of the <b>antrum</b> (a sac-like structure containing fluid) which facilitates ejection into the fallopian tube and a thin layer of <b>theca cells</b></li>
      <li>Eventually, the early antral follicle matures into a <b>mature follicle</b>. This follicle contains both a thick layer of granulosa cells & theca cells. Its antrum completely surrounds the oocyte leaving a space for the granulosa cells to connect to the oocyte in a bridge known as the <b>cumulus oophorus</b></li> 
      <li>The only region of the follicle that travels into the fallopian tube is the oocyte with surrounded by the zona pellucida and a thin layer of granulosa cells. The remainder of the follicle becomes the <b>corpus luteum</b>. This body of cells releases various hormones like estrogen, progesterone & inhibin. It will be discussed more in depth later on</li>
