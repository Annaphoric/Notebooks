    <h2>Lecture 3.8: The Stomach & Duodenum</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>The Stomach</b>
      <li>The stomach is a storage organ</li>
      <li>Complete digestion does not occur in the stomach but more partial breakdown of food occurs (like partial digestion of proteins; carbs & lipids are not significantly digested). Although, no absorption occurs in the stomach</li>
      
      <br><li>Cells located within the stomach include: </li>
        <ul><b>Parietal cells</b>
          <li>Secretes stomach acid containing HCl</li>
            <ul>Stomach acid kills most bacteria that enters the body via food. It also promotes protein denaturation</ul>
          <li>Secretes <b>intrinsic factor</b></li>
            <ul>Binds to vit-B12 to absorb it for RBC production</ul>
            <ul>The only indespensible, necessary part of the stomach. Otherwise, an individual can live without their stomach</ul>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Chief cells</b>
          <li>Secretes <b>pepsinogen</b> (the precursor to the enzyme pepsin for protein digestion)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>G-cells</b>
          <li>Secretes <b>gastrin</b> to stimulate parietal cells</li>
          <li>A type of enteroendocrine cell</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>There are 3 main regions of the stomach: </li>
        <ul>Fundus
          <li>The protruding, superior-most region</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Body
          <li>The centre region</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Antrum
          <li>The inferior region</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>HCl Production in the Stomach</b>
      <li>HCl is secreted by epithelial parietal cells. Their basolateral membrane is closer to blood vessels while the apical membrane is connected to the stomach lumen</li>
      
      <br><li>Parietal cell activity is increased if a meal high is proteins is ingested. H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPases bind to the apical membrane to release H<sup>+</sup> ions into the lumen when stimulated. Gastrin, Histamine, & Acetylcholine promote this process whilst Somatostatin demotes it. These hormones travel from the blood into the parietal cell via the basolateral membrane, initiating a secondary messenger cascade</li>
        <ul>It is shown that HCl can inhibit its own production by inhibiting the entry of gastrin (negative feedback mechanism)</ul>
        <ul>Protein/polypeptide content increases HCl secretion by stimulating the entry of gastrin. They also act as a buffer by binding to H<sup>+</sup> ions, slightly increasing stomach pH (ceasation of negative feedback mechanism)</ul>
        <ul>The H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps act as antiports by transferring H<sup>+</sup> ions from the parietal cell into the stomach lumen and K<sup>+</sup> ions from the stomach lumen into the parietal cell both against their gradient (active transport)</ul>
      
      <br><li>There are also passive K<sup>+</sup> leak channels on the apical membrane (transported from the parietal cell into the stomach lumen)</li>
      <li>The source of H<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions within the cell is via CO<sub>2</sub> as it is converted to carbonic acid via carbonic anhydrase. Cl<sup>-</sup> ions passively travel through leak channels on the apical membrane from the parietal cell into the stomach lumen. There are Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> pumps on the basolateral membrane which actively pump Cl<sup>-</sup> ions from the blood into the parietal cells & passively transfer HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions from the parietal cell into the blood. Cl<sup>-</sup> ions pumped into the stomach lumen pair with H<sup>+</sup> ions to form HCl</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Protein Digestion</b>
      <li>Chief cells secrete pepsinogen (a zymogen) which is a precursor to pepsin. Pepesinogen is readiy converted to pepsin at a low pH environment like the stomach, but not at a neutral pH like the small intestine. Pepsinogen secretion occurs hand-in-hand with HCl secretion</li>
        <ul>Pepsin performs 20% of protein digestion. Specifically, the protein will be broken up into smaller peptides. The rest of protein digestion occurs in the small intestine</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Gastric Motility</b>
      <li>Peristaltic waves drive stomach contraction and the propelling of contents further down the stomach and eventually into the small intestine via the <b>pyloric sphincter</b></li>
        <ul>The pyloric sphinctor divides the stomach from the duodenum of the small intestine. Its main job is to limit the amount of chyme that enters the small intestine</ul>
        <ul>Peristalsis also mixes around food with stomach fluid to form chyme</ul>
      
      <br><li>The presence of foods high in lipids inhibits gastric emptying, slowing down digestion & drug absorption</li>
      
      <br><li>The stomach can hold around 0.5-4L of food/fluid within it</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>The Small Intestine</b>
      <li>The lining of the small intestine is highly convoluted to increase surface area. This lining is known as the <b>brush border</b>. The brush border is made up of cells containing villi that contain many microvilli which further maximise surface area & absorption. It directly comes into contact with the intestinal lumen</li>
      
      <br><li>The 3 regions of the small intestine are: </li>
        <ul>Duodenum
          <li>Closest to the stomach</li>
          <li>It is the shortest</li>
          <li>Plenty of digestion & absorption occurs here</li>
          <li>Surrounded by the large liver and pancreas. Although, these accessory organs never directly touch food</li>
            <ul>The <b>pancreatic duct</b> (from the pancreas) connects directly to the duodenum via the Sphincter of Oddi. The <b>gallbladder</b> (bile storage of liver via the common hepatic duct) connects to the pancreatic duct via the common bile duct, also leading to the duodenum</ul>
            <ul>The pancreas has many vital functions like secreting HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and other digestive enzymes. In fact, 99% pancreatic cells are devoted to exocrine digestion (only 1% secretes endocrines)</ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>Jejunum
          <li>Located in the middle of the small intestine overall</li>
          <li>Plenty of digestion & absorption also occurs here</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Ileum
          <li>Closest to the large intestine</li>
          <li>It is the longest</li>
          <li>Less absorption occurs here</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
