    <h2>Lecture 3.9: Small Intestine Digestion & Absorption</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Secretions into the Small Intestine</b>
      <li>The pancreas secretes HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions to neutralise the chyme that enters the duodenum. Specifically, epithelial pancreatic duct cells secrete these ions</li>
        <ul>Chyme must be neutralised before further moving through the small intestine. Certain enzymes only function at a neutral pH within the small intestine</ul>
      
      <br><li>Pancreatic acinar cells secrete pancreatic enzymes as <b>zymogens</b> (the inactive forms of enzymes that would participate in protein digestion, a proteolytic function; like the zymogen trypsinogen which is converted to trypsin) rather than a proteolytic form. This protects the cells that secrete the enzymes themselves. Aside from protein digestion, these cells also secrete amylase  and lipase in their active form</li>
      
      <br><li>In pancreatic duct cells, the source of H<sup>+</sup> & HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions come from the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> into carbonic acid via carbonic anhydrase. The membrane proteins within these cells are similar to those of stomach parietal cells, except there is no H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump, but rather a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger located on the basolateral membrane which passively transports H<sup>+</sup> ions into blood vessels and actively transports Na<sup>+</sup> ions into the pancreatic duct cell</li>
      
      <br><li>Increased stomach acidity stimulates the small intestine to secrete endocrinal secretin which stimulates the pancreas to release HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions, acting as a buffer (negative feedback). Increased intestinal fatty acids & amino acids stimulates the small intestine to secrete endocrinal Cholecystekynin (CCK) which stimulates the pancreas to release enzymes, absorbing the fatty acids & amino acids (negative feedback)</li>
      
      <br><li>The small intestine is also able to absorb H<sub>2</sub>O</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Liver and Gallbladder Functions</b>
      <li>The liver produces & secretes <b>bile</b> which is made up of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, cholesterol, phospholipids, bile pigments, organic waste & bile salts</li>
        <ul>The main goal of bile, specifically bile salts, is to solubilise dietary lipids to make them easier to break down. Bile salts is derived from cholesterol. 95% of bile salts are reabsorbed by transporters in the ileum & recycled to the liver. The rest is excreted in the feces</ul>
        <ul>The main bile pigment is known as <b>bilirubin</b>. This brown (feces-coloured) pigment is the product of the breakdown of RBCs</ul>
        <ul>The gallbladder then stores & concentrates bile</ul>
        <ul>CCK stimulates the release of bile by contracting the gallbladder</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Carbohydrate Digestion & Absorption</b>
      <li>Carbs within the intestinal lumen are broken down via pancreatic amylase and other enzymes into oligosaccharides and disaccharides. Brush border enzymes secreted by intestinal epithelial cells like maltase & Î±-dextrinase then continue to break down the saccharides into individual monosaccharides</li>
      <li>Inside an intestinal epithelial cell, there are Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps located on the basolateral membrane which actively pump out Na<sup>+</sup> ions and pump in K<sup>+</sup> ions. This creates the gradient needed for GLUT Na<sup>+</sup>/glucose symporters on the apical membrane to passively transfer 1 glucose or galactose for every 1 Na<sup>+</sup> ion into the cell from the intestinal lumen. Fructose does not require another substance to diffuse into the cell; it enters the cell via a GLUT transporter on the apical membrane</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Protein Digestion & Absorption</b>
      <li>Proteolytic pancreatic enzymes that chemically digest proteins include trypsin, chymotrypsin & carboxypeptidases. Intestinal enzymes (brush border enzymes) include aminopeptidases</li>
      
      <br><li>Small chains of amino acids (oligopeptides that are 2-3 amino acids long) are readily absorbed by intestinal cells via secondary active H<sup>+</sup>/peptide cotransporters</li>
      <li>Single amino acids (monopeptides) are absorbed by intestinal cells via secondary active Na<sup>+</sup>/peptide cotransporters</li>
      
      <br><li>Peptides are absorbed similarly to how carbs are absorbed. The difference is that intestinal epithelial cells have 2 types of symporters located on the apical membrane which are the H<sup>+</sup>/oligopeptide symporter & Na<sup>+</sup>/monopeptide symporter</li>
      
      <br><li>About 40-50g of dietary protein is required per daily</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Fat Digestion & Absorption</b>
      <li>Fats or lipids do not require transporters to enter an intestinal epithelial cell and instead are able to passively diffuse across the apical membrane if they are small enough</li>
      
      <br><li>Most dietary fats that enter the body are large and must be broken down into smaller components. Bile salts pair with phospholipids to emulsify fat droplets, breaking them down into smaller emulsion droplets. Intestinal motility via segmentation (mixing) & MMC (a type of peristalsis) also slightly drives dietary fats to physically break down. Pancreatic lipase (lipoprotein lipse) is then able to chemically break down triglycerides in the fat droplet into one monoglyceride & 2 individual fatty acids. These components are then able to form <b>micelles</b> which are spherical-like structures that have the polar regions of the fatty acids or monoglycerides at the surface whilst their nonpolar regions face towards the interior. Micelles act as temporary storages for these components. Either monoglycerides, fatty acids or micelles are able to diffuse into the intestinal cell as long as there is a gradient to do so</li>
      <li>Once fatty acids and monoglycerides enter the intestinal epithelial cell, the smooth ER converts these components back into triacylglycerides. Several triacylglycerides combine with few amphipathic proteins (apoproteins) to form <b>chylomicrons</b>. These chylomicrons diffuse through the basolateral membrane to enter a lymphatic vessel</li>
        <ul>The purpose of forming chylomicrons is to maintain the passive gradient for individual monoglycerides & fatty acids to enter the cell</ul>
        <ul>Since lymphatic vessels are more porous, chylomicrons will prefer to enter them rather than capillaries</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Vitamin & Mineral Absorption</b>
      <li>There are 2 main classes of vitamins: </li>
        <ul>Water-soluble
          <li>Includes B vitamins & vitamin C</li>
          <li>Absorbed by diffusion or mediated transport</li>
          <li>Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> requires intrinsic factor secreted by parietal cells in the stomach to be absorbed</li>
            <ul>This vitamin is required for RBC formation</ul>
            <ul>Individuals who have undergone gastric bypass or a removal of the stomach require vit-B<sub>12</sub> injections. Vit-B<sub>12</sub> deficiency eventually leads to pernicious anemia</ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>Fat-soluble
          <li>Includes vitamins A, D, E & K</li>
          <li>Requires emulsification as micelles before being absorbed</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
