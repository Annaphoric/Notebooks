    <h2>Lecture 3.7: Introduction to Digestion</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Digestion</b>
      <li>There are 4 main roles of the digestive system: </li>
        <ul>Ingest</ul>
        <ul><b>Digest</b>
          <li>The breakdown of food whether chemically or physically</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Absorb</b>
          <li>The transfer of nutrients from food into the bloodstream</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Eliminate</ul>
    
      <br><li>The lumen is continuous with the external environment (From the mouth to the anus)</li>
      
      <br><li>Most of the fluid within the digestive is secreted by glands: </li>
        <ul>1.5L salivary secretions</ul><ul>2L gastric secretions</ul><ul>0.5L bile</ul>
        <ul>1.5L pancreatic secretions</ul><ul>1.5L intestinal secretions</ul>
      
      <br><li>Out of the 1200mL of water we drink per day, 100mL is excreted as feces. Out of the 500-800g of solid foods ingested per day, 50-100g of solids are excrete as feces</li>
      
      <br><li>Overall, about 6.7L of fluids in the small intestine & 1.4L of fluids in the large intestine is absorbed into the bloodstream per day</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Digestive Anatomy</b>
      <li>There are 2 important regions of the digestive system: </li>
        <ul><b>Alimentary Canal</b>
          <li>The tube where food comes into contact with</li>
          <li>About 30ft long in the average adult</li>
          <li>Food travels in the following order (simply put): </li>
            <ul>Mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, anus</ul>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Accessory Organs</b>
          <li>The organs that help with the digestion process but never come into contact with food</li>
          <li>These organs include: </li>
            <ul>Pancreas, liver, gallbladder</ul>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>Absorption occurs most readily at the initial part of the small intestine and occurs somewhat in the stomach & large intestine. In terms of digestion</li>
        <ul>Absorption is the process of moving nutrients from food in the digestive tract into the bloodstream</ul>
        <ul>Secretion is the release of a substance from an organ/gland/cell in the blood into the digestive tract</ul>
        <ul>Elimination is the removal of substances out of the body. This occurs mostly in the renal & respiratory system</ul>
      
      <br><li>The epithelial surface or lining of the GI tract is very convoluted to maximise surface area for a high rate of absorption. For individual's with Celiac's disease (the inability to digest gluten), the surface area of the lining is greatly decreased if gluten is ingested</li>
        <ul>Epithelial cells have one of the highest <b>turnover rate</b> (the replacement of cells with new cells), of any other cell in the body, occuring every 5 days</ul>
        <ul>Enteroendocrine cells secrete hormones into the bloodstream</ul>
      
      <br><li>Deeper within the lining of the GI tract lies blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, enteric nerves, and various muscles (circular & longitudinal). There are also ducts for exocrine secretions from accessory organs into the lumen of the GI tract to eventually be excreted</li>
      
      <br><li>The esophagus contains 2 <b>sphincters</b> (a smooth muscular valve that separates 2 anatomical regions of the body): </li>
        <ul>Upper esophageal sphincter (UES)</ul>
        <ul>Lower esophageal sphincter (LES; also referred to as the cardiac sphincter because it is near the heart)</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Regulation of Gastrointestinal Processes</b>
      <li>Depends mainly on the volume or amount of food in the GI tract, not on the body's nutritional needs. It can also be affected emotional state or physical presence of food. There are 4 digestive factors that help regulate these processes: </li>
        <ul>GI wall distension</ul>
        <ul><b>Chyme</b> osmolarity
          <li>Chyme is the combination of ingested foods & digestive secretions</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Chyme acidity</ul>
        <ul>Chyme concentrations of specific digestion products</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Fate of Food within the Mouth</b>
      <li>Digestion begins in the mouth. <b>Saliva</b> is made up of mucus, H<sub>2</sub>O, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> & enzymes. It is secreted by 3 pairs of glands. The main role of saliva is to lubricate food and act as a buffer. Although food begins to breakdown in the mouth, it is usually not in the mouth very long. Some enzymes in saliva include: </li>
        <ul><b>Lysozyme</b>
          <li>An antibacterial enzyme that plays a role in innate immunity</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Digestive enzymes include: 
          <li><b>Amylase</b></li>
            <ul>Initiates breakdown of carbohydrates</ul>
          <li><b>Lipase</b></li>
            <ul>Also referred to as lingual lipase in the mouth</ul>
            <ul>Initiates breakdown of lipids</ul>
        </ul>
    
      <br><li>The rate of secretion of saliva is regulated by parasympathetic and sympathetic drives</li>
        <ul>Parasympathetic
          <li>There is an increase in salivary gland activity due to increased blood flow to glands</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Sympathetic
          <li>There is a decrease in salivary gland activity due to decreased blood flow to glands</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>As food travels through the pharynx, the epiglottis closes to prevent food from entering the trachea and instead enter the esophagus (preventing choking). Newborns (around 2-years old) can swallow milk & breathe at the same time due to a slightly different position of the epiglottis</li>
      
            
      <br><li><b>Peristalsis</b> (the wave of contractions) then propels food from the esophagus into the stomach</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Heartburn</b>
      <li>Also referred to as acid reflux; it is, in fact, not related to the heart</li>
      
      <br><li>When swallowing food, both esophageal sphincters are relaxed & opened. After food enters the stomach, the sphincters normall close. Heartburn is the regurgitation of stomach chyme because the cardiac spincter does not properly close</li>
    </ul>
