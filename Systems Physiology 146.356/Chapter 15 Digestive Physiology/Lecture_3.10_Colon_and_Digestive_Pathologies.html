    <h2>Lecture 3.10: Colon & Digestive Pathologies</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Colon</b>
      <li>Also referred to as the large intestine</li>
      
      <br><li>The sphincter that divides the small intestine & large intestine is known as the <b>ileocecal sphincter</b></li>
      
      <br><li>There are minimal secretions within the large intestine. Its main role is absorption of Na<sup>+</sup> & H<sub>2</sub>O. Some K<sup>+</sup> secretion occurs here. It also houses the majority of our microbiome</li>
      
      <br><li>Farts or <b>flatus</b> are composed of N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, CH<sub>4</sub>. All of these components are byproducts of bacteria metabolism (from our microbiome)</li>
      
      <br><li>Contents that enter the large intestine usually stay there for 18-24 hours</li>
      
      <br><li>The defecation reflex is stimulated by the distension of the rectum walls and is neurally mediated. The external anal sphincter is controlled voluntarily, unlike the internal one. The valsalva maneuver aids the defecation process (similar to how babies are delivered)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>The Gut Microbiota</b>
      <li>Microbiome bacteria or microbiota produce vit-K which is important for blood-clotting. Vit-K is then absorbed into the blood</li>
      
      <br><li>Research shows that the microbiome is not entirely made up of bacteria, but it is the majority. In fact, 99% of the microbiome is bacteria whilst the rest are archea, fungi & viruses. Overuse of antibiotics can kill our microbiome, leading to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or other autoimmune disorders</li>
      
      <br><li>An important role of the microbiome is to educate/strengthen the immune system</li>
      
      <br><li>Microbiota are able to metabolise substances that our bodies cannot like dietary fibre</li>
      
      <br><li>A more diverse microbiome indicates a healthier individual. Research shows there is a link between having a healthy, diverse microbiome and a good mental state (psychobiome)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Digestive System Pathologies</b>
      <li>Digestive system pathologies include: </li>
        <ul><b>Celiac's Disease</b>
          <li>An autoimmune disease characterised by the loss of intestinal surface area, leading to decreased nutrient absorption and diarrhea</li>
          <li>This occurs if an individual which this condition consumes the wheat protein gluten. This is usually diagnosed in adults ages 20-50</li>
          <li>Treatments include a gluten-free diet, promoting healing of the intestine</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Regurgitation</b>
          <li>A reflex coordinated by the medulla of the brainstem (referred to as the vomiting centre) due to excessive distension of the stomach, increased cranial pressure, intense rotation or intense pain</li>
          <li>The purpose of this reflex is to eliminate foreign substances that entered the body</li>
          <li>There are drugs to stop excessive vomiting</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Ulcers</b>
          <li>The erosion of the gastric surface, usually occurring in the lower esophagus but can occur in the duodenum</li>
          <li>Normally, the stomach is able to buffer the acidic condtions, preventing HCl from leaking to the internal section of the stomach or other regions. An ulcer penetrates through the stomach's protective mechanism, causing irritation</li>
          <li>Ulcers are known to be caused by the bacteria Helicobacter pylori. It is still unsure if stress causes ulcers</li>
          <li>Treatments include 2 classes of drugs: </li>
            <ul>Histamine receptor blockers
              <li>Blocks histamine from binding to receptors, decreasing inflammation</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump inhibitors
              <li>Inhbits H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps located within parietal cells, preventing HCl from being secreted into the stomach lumen</li>
              <li>Like omeprazole</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        
      <br><li>We can live without our gallbladder, stomach (requiring vit-B<sub>12</sub> injections), oesophagus, salivary glands and large intestine but cannot live without our pancreas, small intestine, liver. If the an organ that we can live without is removed, it must be compensated somehow through diet or treatments</li>
    </ul>
