    <h2>Lecture 2.10: The Respiratory Cycle</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>The Respiratory System</b>
      <li>The main goal of the respiratory system is to deliver O<sub>2</sub> to tissues in the body and remove CO<sub>2</sub>. It can also serve towards innate immunity and speech</li>
      
      <br><li>The main functional unit is the <b>alveoli</b></li>
        <ul>Alveoli are small air sacs where gas exchange occurs</ul>
        <ul>They are normally very abundant in the lungs</ul>
        <ul>They are very vascular, surrounded by plenty capillaries</ul>
        <ul>Alveoli are only one cell thick (only have one layer of cells)</ul>
        
        <br><ul>There are 2 types of alveolar cells: 
          <li><b>Type I</b></li>
            <ul>Most abundant</ul>
            
          
          <br><li>Type II</li>
            <ul>Less abundant</ul>
            <ul>Produce & secrete <b>surfactant</b>
              <li>A mixture of phospholipids & protein that coats alveoli and lowers their surface tension to prevent enlargement</li> 
              <li>It also increases lung compliance or expandibility and decreases physical workload of breathing</li>
              <li>The effect of surfactant is greater in smaller alveoli than larger ones</li>
              <li>Deep breaths increase the secretion of surfactant by stretching type II alveolar cells while shallow breaths decrease its secretion</li>
              <li>Production of surfactant in the fetal lungs occurs during late gestation (28 weeks of fetal growth), but not enough until cortisol stimulates its further production (until after about 37 weeks of fetal growth). Babies are normally kept in utero until around 38 weeks because they do not breath until after delivery. For this reason, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature babies can occur</li>
              <li>Without sufficient surfactant, alveoli can collapse with each breath and they would be unable to be filled with air. A ventilator is required to have enough oxygen and stay alive</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul><b>Anatomy of the Chest Wall & Lungs</b>
      <li>The diaphragm is the primary muscle during respiration</li>
        <ul>It is a dome-shaped muscle that separates the thoracic & abdominal cavity</ul>
        <ul>It lies right below (inferior to) the lungs</ul>
      
      <br><li>External & internal intercostals are also considered to be primary muscles during respiration</li>
        <ul>Located between every rib</ul>
      
      <br><li>Secondary muscles include: </li>
        <ul>Pectoralis minor</ul>
        <ul>Sternocleidomastoid</ul>
        <ul>Scalenes</ul>
        <ul>Other abdominal wall muscles</ul>
        <ul>These muscles mainly facilitate inhalation</ul>
      
      <br><li>The <b>parietal pleura</b> lies on the surface of the chest wall in between the chest wall & lungs</li>
      <li>The <b>visceral pleura</b> lies on the surface of the lungs</li>
      <li>The thin space in between the 2 pleura is known as the <b>intrapleural space</b> (or interpleural)</li>
        <ul>This space houses the fluid known as the <b>intrapleural fluid</b>. The average person has about 2mL of this fluid</ul>
        <ul>The pressure of the intrapleural fluid (P<sub>ip</sub>) is arises from the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid itself
          <li>This pressure allows the lungs to be pulled towards the chest wall during an inhalation</li>
          <li>If P<sub>ip</sub> isn't low enough, the lungs will collapse, rendering it unable to be inflated with air. P<sub>ip</sub> must always remain lower than P<sub>atm</sub> (P<sub>ip</sub> < 0)in order for the lungs to work properly</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Transpulmonary pressure (P<sub>tp</sub>) is the difference between alveolar presure (P<sub>alv</sub>) & intrapleural pressure (P<sub>ip</sub>)
          <li class="red">P<sub>tp</sub> = P<sub>alv</sub> - P<sub>ip</sub></li>
          <li>Alveolar pressure is always greater than intrapleural pressure. The changes in P<sub>alv</sub> during respiration are sinusoidal</li>
          <li>P<sub>tp</sub> is also characterised by the difference between the pressures inside & outside the lungs</li>
          <li>This pressure is a major contributor to lung volume & compliance</li>
        </ul>
      
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>The Respiratory Cycle</b>
      <li>One respiratory or breath cycle consists of one inhalation & exhalation</li>
        <ul>One cycle usually takes about 4s on average</ul>
      
      <br><li>In a breath, air travels through the nostrils or mouth, larynx, and trachea which branches off into the left & right bronchi. Then, the bronchi branch further into bronchioles and finally terminating with alveoli</li>
      
      <br><li>Pressure always moves from a higher partial pressure to a lower one. Pressure & volume are inversely proportional as stated by Boyle's Law. For physiology purposes, P<sub>atm</sub> is constant and other pressures are taken in relative to this pressure; therefore, by convention, P<sub>atm</sub> = 0;</li>
      
      <br><li>There are 3 main phases of one respiratory cycle: </li>
        <ul><b>Inhalation/Inspiration</b>
          <li>The diaphragm is pushed downwards, creating (-) pressure in the lungs (specifically P<sub>ip</sub>) relative to P<sub>atm</sub> and to make room for incoming air volume</li>
          <li>The external intercostals pull the rib cage up & outward</li>
          <li>Air volume increases until 0.5L at peak inhalation</li>
          <li>P<sub>alv</sub> slowly drops below P<sub>atm</sub> and rises to equal P<sub>atm</sub> at peak inhalation</li>
          <li>P<sub>ip</sub> decreases linearly until peak inhalation, due to an increase in vacuum (spring-like; as though a spring extends) pressure</li>
          <li>P<sub>tp</sub> increases linearly until peak inhalation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Peak Inhalation</b>
          <li>The intermediate point of the respiratory cycle where chest expansion is greatest, P<sub>ip</sub> is lowest, vacuum pressure is highest and P<sub>tp</sub> is greatest</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Exhalation/Expiration</b>
          <li>The diaphragm recoils upwards, causing the lungs to expel the air volume and relax. This is normally a passive process, requiring no additional contraction</li>
          <li>In a forced exhalation, the internal intercostals pull the rib cage down & inward</li>
          <li>Air volume decreases from 0.5L until the end of the cycle</li>
          <li>P<sub>alv</sub> slowly rises above P<sub>atm</sub> and drops to equal P<sub>atm</sub> at the end of the cycle</li>
          <li>P<sub>ip</sub> increases linearly until the end of the cycle due to a decrease in vacuum (spring-like; as though a spring returns to equillibrium) pressure</li>
          <li>P<sub>tp</sub> decreases linearly until the end of the cycle</li>
        </ul>
        
    </ul>
