    <h2>Lecture 2.12: Gas Exchange</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Introduction</b>
      <li>In the lungs, O<sub>2</sub> travels from the alveoli to the blood and CO<sub>2</sub> travels from the blood to the alveoli</li>
      <li>In tissue, O<sub>2</sub> travels from the blood to the tissue and CO<sub>2</sub> travels from the tissue to the blood</li>
      
      <br><li>The amount of gas in an area is given by its <b>partial pressure</b> P (out of every other gas in that same region). Pressures always move along a pressure gradient, from higher partial pressure to a lower one. The average partial pressures for various regions are: </li>
        <ul>In the atmosphere, P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> = 160mmHg & P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> = 0.3mmHg</ul>
        <ul>In the alveoli, P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> = 105mmHg & P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> = 40mmHg</ul>
        <ul>In veins, P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> = 40mmHg & P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> = 46mmHg</ul>
        <ul>In arteries, P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> = 100mmHg & P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> = 40mmHg</ul>
        <ul>In cells, P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> < 40mmHg & P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> < 46mmHg</ul>
        <ul>In the mitchondria, P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> < 5mmHg</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Ventilation</b>
      <li class="blue">Changes in gaseous partial pressures & volumes during respiration</li>
      <li>The average change in volume during ventilation is 4L</li>
      
      <br><li>Hyperventilation</li>
        <ul>Also referred to as over-breathing</ul>
        <ul>CO<sub>2</sub> production is less than alveolar ventilation since breathing is occurring too rapidly and more CO<sub>2</sub> is being exhaled</ul>
        <ul>Air volume increases, P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> slightly increases and P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> decreases</ul>
      
      <br><li>Hypoventilation</li>
        <ul>Also referred to as under-breathing</ul>
        <ul>CO<sub>2</sub> production is greater than alveolar ventilation since breathing is occurring too slowly and less CO<sub>2</sub> is being exhaled</ul>
        <ul>Air volume decreases, P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> decreases and P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> increases</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Hemoglobin</b>
      <li>A protein containing 4 polypeptide subunits normally found in all red blood cells (RBCs)</li>
      
      <li>The main purpose of hemoglobin (Hb) is to bind to O<sub>2</sub> & deliver it to tissues in the body. One Hb molecule can bind to up to 4 O<sub>2</sub> molecules (one for each subunit)</li>
      
      <li>Hb can be either completely saturated with O<sub>2</sub> or completely lack O<sub>2</sub> but rarely partially saturated. Hemoglobin saturated with O<sub>2</sub> is referred to as oxyhemoglobin (HbO<sub>2</sub>) and unusaturated hemoglobin is referred to as deoxyhemoglobin (Hb)</li>
      <br><li>Most O<sub>2</sub> found in the body is bound to hemoglobin</li>
      
      <br><li>% Hb-saturation is calculated by determining the amount of O<sub>2</sub> bound to Hb and dividing it by the maximum capacity of Hb to bind to O<sub>2</sub> in the form of a percentage. % Hb-saturation is usually plotted on the vertical axis of the Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation Curve while P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> in mmHg is plotted horizontally</li>
        <ul class="red">% Hb-saturation = ((Bound O<sub>2</sub> to Hb)(100%)) / Hb-Binding-Capacity</ul>
        <ul class="blue">The O<sub>2</sub>-Hb Dissociation Curve demonstrates that the % of Hb that is saturated with O<sub>2</sub> is dependent on P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>. As P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> increases, the % of HbO<sub>2</sub> also increases until P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> reaches venous partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> (40mmHg). At this point, the slope of the tangent line to the curve decreases (the % plateaus to 100%) and the % of HbO<sub>2</sub> is 80%
          <li>This plateau ensures that tissues obtain the proper amount of O<sub>2</sub> even in high altitudes (conditions having a low P<sub>O<sub>2</sub>-atm</sub>)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>This curve proves that Hemoglobin molecules can only be completely saturated or unsaturated with O<sub>2</sub>. If one O<sub>2</sub> molecule binds to a heme of Hb, Hb will change shape to have much greater affinity for 3 more O<sub>2</sub> molecules (high cooperativity)
          <li>High cooperativity displays ideal conditions to unload its O<sub>2</sub> content to tissues</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Within the difference between venous P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> (40mmHg) & arterial P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> (100mmHg), around 20% of HbO<sub>2</sub> unloads its O<sub>2</sub> content to tissues</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Factors Affecting the Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation Curve</b>
      <li>A rightwards shift of the curve can indicate an increase in metabolic activity, temperature, P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, blood acidity (H<sup>+</sup> ion concentration; decreased pH; due to an increae in P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>), 2,3-diphosphglycerate (DPG; BPG; produced during glycolysis and has an affinity for Hb but is reversible)</li>
        <ul>All of these result in a lower affinity of Hb to bind to O<sub>2</sub> and more HbO<sub>2</sub> unloading. There would be less % of HbO<sub>2</sub> at a given P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub></ul>
      
      <br><li>A leftwards shift of the curve is causes and results in inverse effects as in a rightwards shift</li>
      
      <br><li>Fetal Hb has a higher affinity for O<sub>2</sub> than adult Hb, causing less unloading of O<sub>2</sub>. P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> of fetal Hb can only reach a max of 35mmHg max</li>
      
      <br><li>Anemia is a condition characterised by fewer normal RBCs than a normal amount</li>
        <ul>With fewer RBCs, there are fewer total hemoglobin molecules in the body</ul>
        <ul>In terms of the O<sub>2</sub>-Hb Dissociation Curve, the shape of the curve remains almost the same as in a normal curve (same high level of cooperativity), but there is a lower overall magnitude of HbO<sub>2</sub> in the body</ul>
      
      <br><li>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a toxin that has a 200 times more affinity for heme than O<sub>2</sub></li>
        <ul>At 50% CO-Hb, the potential of delivering O<sub>2</sub> to tissues is halved</ul>
        <ul>In terms of the curve, the shape of curve changes and there is a lower level of cooperativity</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Distribution of CO<sub>2</sub> in the Body</b>
      <li>Average Distribution of CO<sub>2</sub>: </li>
        <ul>10% is dissolved in blood as a free molecule</ul>
        <ul>25-30% is bound to Hb as a carbamide group, forming carbamino-Hb</ul>
        <ul>60-65% is converted to HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (bicarbonate ion)</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Carbonic anhydrase</b> is the enzyme that catalyses the synthesis reaction of H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (Carbonic acid) from H<sub>2</sub>O & CO<sub>2</sub></li>
        <ul>H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub> ➝ H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (catalysed by carbonic anhydrase)</ul>
      <li>H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is then sponaneously decomposed into HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> & H<sup>+</sup> ions</li>
        <ul>H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> ➝ HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + H<sup>+</sup></ul>
        <ul>Therefore, increasing [CO<sub>2</sub>] decreases pH</ul>

    </ul>
