    <h2>Lecture 2.14: Exercise & Respiration</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Minute Ventilation</b>
      <li class="blue">Measured as the average amount of air volume that flows in & out of the body per minute (units in L/min)</li>
      
      <li>Minute ventilation is around 9L/min at normal resting level</li>
      
      <br><li>Not affected much at an arterial P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> of around 60mmHg or higher, but is affected more at a partial pressure lower than 60mmHg. If P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is lower than 60mmHg due to lung disease or high altitude, minute ventilation increases</li>
        <ul>Peripheral chemoreceptors detect low levels P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and act to adjust it by increasing ventilation</ul>
        <ul>Since mild to moderate anemia does not affect P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> much, minute ventilation does not change if it is present</ul>
      
      <br><li>Contrarily, any change of arterial P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, regardless of how much, will alter minute ventilation</li>
        <ul>Both peripheral & central chemoreceptors are able to detect changes in arterial P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> or [H<sup>+</sup>]. Central chemoreceptors are most likely to be stimulated by these changes</ul>
        <ul>Even metabolic H<sup>+</sup> ions (not relating to levels of CO<sub>2</sub>; like in lactic acid production) itself can stimulate chemoreceptors, specifically peripheral chemoreceptors which are most sensitive to these changes</ul>
      
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Changes in Gas Concentrations during Exercise</b>
      <li>Arterial P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> usually remains constant (100mHg) regardless of the amount of exercise</li>
      
      <br>Normally at rest, minute ventilation is around 9L/min, arterial P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> is 40mmHg, and arterial [H<sup>+</sup>] is 36nmol/L
      
      <br><li>During moderate exercise, minute ventilation increases to about 30L/min, arterial P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> decreases slightly to around 38mmHg, and arterial [H<sup>+</sup>] increase slightly to around 38nmol/L</li>
      
      <br><li>During maximal exercise, minute ventilation increases to about 90L/min, arterial P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> decreases to around 30mmHg (since exhalation of CO<sub>2</sub> occurs faster than production of metabolic CO<sub>2</sub>), and arterial [H<sup>+</sup>] increases to around 54nmol/L (due to lactic acid buildup)</li>
      
      <br><li>As mentioned in the previous chapter, the limiting factor of strenuous exercise is cardiac output, rather than ventilation</li>
      
      <br><li>Once an exercise training is initiated, minute ventilation immediately increases. This is because: </li>
        <ul>Reflexes of mechanoreceptors in joints & muscles are stimulated</ul>
        <ul>Body temperature is increased</ul>
        <ul>The brain communicates with motor neurons to fire</ul>
        <ul>Not chemical or gaseous changes</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Respiratory Abnormalities</b>
      <li><b>Hypoxia</b></li>
        <ul>A deficiency in O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues</ul>
        <ul>Causes include: 
          <li>Hypoventilation</li>
            <ul>Accompanied by an increase in P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub></ul>
          
          <br><li>Diffusion Impairment</li>
            <ul>Results from the thickening of alveolar membranes and decrease of their surface area</ul>
          
          <br><li>Ventilation-perfusion Inequality</li>
            <ul>Observed as the most common reason for hypoxia</ul>
            <ul>Seen in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) like emphysema or chronic bronchitis (characterised by airway inflammation & excess mucus production)</ul>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</b></li>
        <ul>Also referred to as COPD</ul>
        <ul>A type of COPD is <b>Emphysema</b>
          <li>As mentioned previously, emphysema is characterised by the merging of alveoli</li>
          <li>Results in a decrease total surface area for gas exchange, increased compliance, decreased elasticity, increased airway resistance and the workload of respiration</li>
            <ul>If breathing requires more work, hypoventilation can occur where P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> increases & P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> decreases (hypoxia)</ul>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li><b>High Altitudes</b></li>
        <ul>At a high altitude like on Mount Everest, the P<sub>atm</sub> drops to around 253mmHg compared to sea level where P<sub>atm</sub> is normally 760mmHg. For this reason, P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> on Mount Everest is around 53mmHg compared to at sea level where P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is normally greater than 100mmHg, even though the percentage of O<sub>2</sub> in the air remains at a 21% concentration</ul>
        
        <br><ul>Benefits of high altitude training include: 
          <li>An increase in erythropoeitin (EPO; a hormone produced by the kidneys), leading to an increase in erythrocytes (RBCs), hemoglobin molecules and arterial P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub></li>
            <ul>This effect is similar to the effects caused by blood doping (injection of hematocrit right before an athletic event, giving an athlete an unfair advantage in these competitions)</ul>
          
          <br><li>An increase in number & density of skeletal capillaries (angiogenesis), leading to more efficient O<sub>2</sub> delivery</li>
          
          <br><li>An increase in the amount of mitochondira, especially in muscle tissue</li>
          
          <br><li>An increase in myoglobin</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
