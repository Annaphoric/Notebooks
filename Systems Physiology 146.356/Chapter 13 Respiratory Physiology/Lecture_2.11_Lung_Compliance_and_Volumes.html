    <h2>Lecture 2.11: Lung Compliance & Volumes</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Lung Compliance</b>
      <li class="blue">Compliance refers to degree of stretch or expandibility, inverse to stiffness</li>
      
      <br><li>Lung compliance is the differential of volume with respect to P<sub>tp</sub>: </li>
        <ul>Lung-Compliance = dV / dP<sub>tp</sub></ul>
      
      <br><li>Surfactant plays a great role in magnitude of lung compliance</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Lung Pathologies</b>
      <li>Various kinds of lungs pathlogies include: </li>
        <ul><b>Pulmonary Fibrosis</b>
          <li>Also referred to as stiff lung</li>
          <li>Characterised by low lung compliance, due to an increase in P<sub>tp</sub> and possibly a decrease in lung volume (specifically in tidal volume) since lung tissue is damaged and scarred. This also causes an increase in minute ventilation (frequency of respiration)</li>
          <li>Symptoms include shortness of breath, <b>pulmonary hypertension</b> (high blood pressure due to compression of lung capillaries & nearby capillaries)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Emphysema</b>
          <li>Also referred to as smoker's lung or floppy lung</li>
          <li>Characterised by high lung compliance & low lung elasticity (recoil) due to the destruction of alveolar walls. This also causes a decrease in total surface area for gas exchange</li>
          <li>Symptoms include hypoxia</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Asthma</b>
          <li>Characterised by an increased resistance of the airways due to vasoconstriction, increasing pressure within the lungs</li>
          <li>Treatments include using a bronchodilator which can be portable</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Lung Volumes</b>
      <li><b>Tidal volume</b> (TV) is the changes in volume during a normal respiratory volume; it appears sinusoidal. TV increases during exercise. This volume is normally 500mL</li>
        <ul><b>Inspiratory reserve volume</b> (IRV) is the difference between air volume in a total forced inhalation and the air volume during peak inhalation of tidal volume. This volume is normally 3000mL</ul>
        <ul><b>Expiratory reserve volume</b> (ERV) is the difference between air volume in a total forced expiration and the air volume at the end of a respiratory cycle in tidal volume. This volume is normally 1200mL</ul>
        <ul><b>Inspiratory capacity</b> (IC) is the sum of IRV & TV. This volume is normally 3500mL
          <li>IC = IRV + TV</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Vital capacity</b> (VC) is the sum of TV, IRV & ERV. VC is dependant on lung size, which normally stays constant as an adult. This volume is normally 4700mL
          <li class="red">VC = TV + IRV + ERV</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Residual volume</b> (RV) is the air volume that is left in the lungs, even after a forced exhalation. This volume is normally 1200mL</li>
        <ul><b>Functional residual capacity</b> (FRC) is the sum of ERV & RV. This volume is normally 2400mL
          <li>FRC = ERV + RV</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Total lung capacity</b> (TLC) is the sum of VC & RV. This volume is normally 5900mL
          <li class="red">TLC = VC + RV</li>
          <li>TLC = IRV + TV + ERV + RV</li>
        </ul>
