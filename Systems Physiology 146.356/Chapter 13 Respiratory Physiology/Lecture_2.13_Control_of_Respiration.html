    <h2>Lecture 2.13: Control of Respiration</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Introduction</b>
      <li>Respiration is controlled by brainstem centres and dependent on motor neurons</li>
        <ul>Motor neurons excite or depolarise the diaphragm & intercostal muscles, causing them to contract</ul>
        <ul>Inspiratory & expiratory neurons are excited in an oscillating fashion. When inspiratory neurons are excited, expiratory neurons are inhibited and vice versa</ul>
        
        <br><ul>Along the brainstem, the pons lies superior to the medulla oblongata
          <li>Within the pons, there are 2 neuronal groups of interest: </li>
            <ul><b>Pneumotaxic Center</b>
              <li>Sends signals to the Apneustic Center or the DRG</li>
            </ul>
            <ul><b>Apneustic Center</b>
              <li>Receives the signal from the apneustic center to regulate the DRG</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Both regulate inspiration & expiration in different ways. Large doses of opioids inhibit inspiratory neurons, ceasing respiration</ul>
          
          <br><li>Within the medulla oblongata, the Respiratory Rhythmicity Center is made up of the ventral respiratory group (VRG) and the dorsal respiratory group (DRG)</li>
            <ul>The VRG is primarily excited during forced exhalation and innervates the internal intercostals. It also contains the <b>pre-Botzinger complex</b> which generates the rhythm of respiration (sets the basal respiratory rate; analagous to cardiac pacemaker cells)</ul>
            
            <br><ul>The DRG is primarily excited during inhalation and innervates the external intercostals</ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Respiratory Chemoreceptors</b>
      <li>Receptors that detect various chemical concentration levels and communicate with the pons & medulla to regulate breathing</li>
      
      <br><li>There are 2 types of respiratory chemoreceptors: </li>
        <ul><b>Peripheral</b>
          <li>Located within the carotid arteries & aorta</li>
          <li>Monitors P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>, P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> & [H<sup>+</sup>], but mainly stimulated by CO<sub>2</sub> & H<sup>+</sup> levels</li>
          <li>Synapses with neurons that are connect to the DRG & VRG </li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Central</b>
          <li>Located within the medulla oblongata</li>
          <li>Stimulated by only by an increase of [H<sup>+</sup>] due to an increase in P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> but not O<sub>2</sub></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome</b>
      <li>Also referred to as SIDS or crib death</li>
      <li>Characterised by a sudden death of a baby younger than 1 year old</li>
      <li>It is currently a leading cause of post-neonatal death in the US & Western World</li>
      <li>Definite cause is unknown but it is likely that SIDS is due to an impairment in the development of respiratory chemoreceptors. Proper development of these receptors occurs within the first year of life</li>
      
      <br><li>There is also evidence showing a correlation between SIDS & abnormal levels of brainstem serotonin (5-HT) secreted by peripheral chemoreceptor neuronal cells due to a lack of tryptophan hydroxylase which catalyses the 5-HT synthesis</li>
    </ul>
