    <h2>Lecture 2.7: Blood Vessels, Pressure & the Lymphatic System</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Blood Vessels</b>
      <li class="blue">Blood vessels are any vessel that that can carry blood, which can be either oxygenated or deoxygenated</li>
      
      <br><li>Relaxing arterial smooth muscle leads to its vasodilation. Contracting this muscle leads to vasocontraction</li>
      
      <br><li><b>Compliance</b> (expandibility) is the derivative of blood volume with respect to pressure</li>
        <ul>A higher change in pressure indicates a lower compliance & vice versa</ul>
        <ul>There is a higher change in pressure from systole to diastole as arteries branch to arterioles then capillaries and so on</ul>
      
      <br><li>Comparing veins with arteries: </li>
        <ul><b>Arteries</b>
          <li>All arteries carry blood away from the heart</li>
          <li>Most of them carry oxygenated blood; the exception is the pulmonary artery</li>
          <li>They are generally under a higher pressure than veins</li>
          <li>More elastic and likely to return to its original shape</li>
          <li>Have a lower compliance and less able to expand as much</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Veins</b>
          <li>All veins carry blood to the heart.</li>
          <li>Most of them carry dexygenated blood; the exception is the pulmonary vein</li>
          <li>They are generally under a lower pressure than arteries</li>
          <li>Less elastic and likely to return to its original shape</li>
          <li>Have a higher compliance and able to expand to a greater degree</li>
        </ul>
        
      <br><li>At any moment in time, about 61% of blood is in veins or venules, 7% of blood is in arterioles or capillaries, 11% of blood is in arteries, 9% of blood is in the heart and 12% is within the pulmonary circulation</li>
      
      <br><li>In the systemic circuit, the aorta branches off to arteries then arterioles and finally capillaries which delivers oxygen from oxygenated blood to tissues. Deoxygenated blood is then carried to venules which branch off to veins and finally the vena cava which delivers the blood to the right atrium of the heart</li>
      
      <br><li>Blood vessels are made up of a few layers from deepest to most superficial: </li>
        <ul><b>Endothelium</b>
          <li>The deepest layer of any blood vessel made of cells</li>
          <li>This layer makes direct contact with blood within the vessels</li>
          <li>Capillaries do not have any other layer besides this one</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Elastic layer</b>
          <li>Gives the blood vessel its elastic properties</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Smooth muscle layer</ul>
        <ul>Cartilage</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Blood Pressure</b>
      <li class="blue">The pressure that blood exerts on the walls of the arteries (in mmHg)</li>
      <li>It is calculated as: </li>
        <ul class="red">BP = SP / DP</ul>
        <ul>Blood pressure is the arterial systolic pressure divided by the diastolic pressure</ul>
      <li>BP is normally 120/80</li>
      
      <br><li>Systolic pressure refers to the maximum pressure in arteries achieved during the peak of ventricular ejection</li>
      <li>Diastolic pressure refers to the minimum presure in arteries achieved right before ventricular ejection</li>
      
      
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Pulse pressure</b>
      <li>The difference between the systolic & diastolic pressure: </li>
        <ul class="red">PP = SP - DP</ul>
      <li>It is normally 40mHg</li>
      
      <li>PP can change according to 3 main factors: </li>
        <ul>Stroke volume
          <li>Increasing SV increases PP</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>SV ejection speed
          <li>Increasing SV ejection speed increases PP</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Arterial compliance (C<sub>a</sub>)
          <li>Increasing C<sub>a</sub> decreases PP</li>
          <li>This will normally decrease with age, eventually leading to <b>arteriosclerosis</b> (the deterioration of the arteries). As a result, systolic pressure increases due to stiffer arteries & diastolic pressure decreases due to loss of elasticity</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul><b>Mean Arterial Pressure</b>
      <li>The average arterial pressure that exists throughout the body</li>
      <li>Since diastole lasts longer than diastole, a change in diastolic pressure will have a greater effect on MAP than systolic pressure</li>
      <li>There are 2 ways to calculate MAP: </li>
        <ul class="red">MAP = (SP + 2 DP)/3</ul>
        <ul class="red">MAP = (CO)(TPR)</ul>
        <ul>Key terms: SP = Systolic pressure, DP = Diastolic pressure, CO = Cardiac output, TPR = Total peripheral resistance</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Total peripheral resistance</b> (TPR) is the combined resistance of blood flow in all systemic blood vessels</li>
        <ul>This decreases during exercise due to vasodilation of arteries connecting to muscle tissue</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Blood Flow Regulation in Organs</b>
      <li>There are 2 main ways to control blood flow in the body: </li>
        <ul><b>Local Control</b>
          <li><b>Active hyperemia</b> is a local reponse to an increase of metabolic activity in a specific organ</li>
            <ul>This is characterised by an increase in blood flow via vasodilation of arterioles</ul>
            <ul>The stimulus for this is an decrease in O<sub>2</sub>, and/or an increase in CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sup>+</sup> ions, adenosine (product of ATP degradation), K<sup>+</sup> or NO (Nitric oxide) located in organ interstitial fluid</ul>
            <ul>Most common in organs with the highest metabolic range like skeletal muscles, cardiac muscle, and various glands</ul>
          
          <br><li><b>Flow autoregulation</b> is the strict homeostasis of blood flow as a result of a change in blood pressure</li>
            <ul>This is also characterised by an increase in blood flow due to arteriolar vasodilation or a decrease in blood flow via arteriolar vasoconstriction</ul>
            <ul>The stimulus for this is the same metabolites as mentioned in active hyperemia, with the addition of a decrease in blood vessel compliance located at the targeted organ</ul>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Extrinsic Control</b></ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Capillaries</b>
      <li class="blue">The primary exchange vessels of the circulatory system</li>
      
      <li>The velocity of blood flow is lowest in capillaries due to their lowest individual cross sectional area and highest sum of cross sectional areas in a region compared to other blood vessels (like arterioles & venules)</li>
        <ul>This maximises the time available for gas diffusion & nutrient exchange</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>The Lymphatic System</b>
      <li class="blue">The vessel system in the body responsible for recovering interstitial fluid that leaks out during capillary exchange and various other functions like the production + storage of leukocytes</li>
        <ul>As much as 4L of fluid can be collected into lymphatic vessels</ul>
        <ul>Without this system, severe edema (swelling) of tissues would occur</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Lymph</b> (lymphatic fluid) contained within lymphatic vessels is eventually pumped into subclavian veins and into the heart to continue into the circulatory system</li>
      
      <br><li>Lymphatic vessels exist in almost every major tissue in our body; an exception is the brain</li>
        <ul>Although, recent studies have shown that lymphatic-like vessels are appearing near the brain</ul>
      
      <br><li>Lymphatic vessels are generally more porous and have larger pores, reflecting their ability to pick up foreign or malignant cells</li>
    </ul>
