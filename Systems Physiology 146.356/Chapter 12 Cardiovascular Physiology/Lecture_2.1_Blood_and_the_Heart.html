    <h2>Lecture 2.1: Blood & the Heart</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Components of Blood</b>
      <li class="blue">Blood contains 55% plasma, 45% erythrocytes (red blood cells; RBCs), making up the hematocrit (V<sub>RBCs</sub> / V<sub>(total blood)</sub>) & a small % of leukocytes (white blood cells; WBCs) & platelets, known as the buffy coat</li>
        <ul>Plasma is made up of 90% H<sub>2</sub>O, many proteins like albumins, globulins & fibrinogens, and 10% nutrients, hormones & ions
          <li>Albumins are most abundant & play a role in regulating [H<sub>2</sub>O]<sub>blood</sub></li>
          <li>Globulins (immunoglobulins; antibodies) play a role in adaptive immunity</li>
          <li>Fibrinogen helps in blood clotting</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>Blood consists of <b>formed elements</b> which are cells themselves and their fragments</li>
        <ul>The cells are the erythrocytes and leukocytes
          <li>Erythrocytes carry O<sub>2</sub> via hemoglobin binding; more RBCs lead to thicker blood</li>
          <li>Leukocytes play an important role in adaptive immunity</li>
          <li>These blood cells are made in the bone marrow</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>The cell fragments are platelets
          <li>Platelets play an essential role in blood clotting</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>The Circulatory System</b>
      <li>Bloods flows throughout our body due to the pumping of the heart</li>
      <li>There are 3 main circuits (pathways that blood takes): </li>
        <ul><b>Pulmonary Circuit</b>
          <li>Initiates at the right side of the heart and flows into the lungs</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Coronary Circuit</b>
          <li>Initiates at the left side of the heart and flows into cardiomyocytes</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Systemic Circuit</b>
          <li>Initiates at the left side of the heart and flows into organs</li>
          <li>Different organs have different flow rates at rest: </li>
            <ul>Brain -> 650mL/min (13%)</ul>
            <ul>Heart -> 215mL/min (4%)</ul>
            <ul>Skeletal Muscle -> 1030mL/min (20%)</ul>
            <ul>Skin -> 430mL/min (9%)</ul>
            <ul>Kidneys -> 950mL/min (20%)</ul>
            <ul>Adominal organs -> 1200mL/min (24%)</ul>
            <ul>Other -> 525mL/min (10%)</ul>
            <ul>Total -> 5000mL/min (100%)</ul>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>There are 4 great vessels that directly branch from the heart: </li>
        <ul><b>Vena Cava</b>
          <li>Returns deoxygenated blood from tissues collected in veins & venules into the right atrium of the heart</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Pulmonary Arteries/Trunks</b>
          <li>Carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle into the lungs</li>
        </ul><ul><b>Pulmonary Veins</b>
          <li>Returns oxygenated blood from the lungs into the left arium of the heart</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Aorta</b>
          <li>Carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle into tissues via arteries, arterioles & capillaries</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>There are 4 valves that divide sections of the heart or separate it from vessels: </li>
        <ul><b>Semilunar Valves</b> (including aortic, on the left side, and pulmonary, on the right side)
          <li>These valves separate the heart from efferent great vessels</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Atrioventricular Valves</b> (including bicuspid/mitral, on the left side, and tricuspid, on the right side)
          <li>These valves divide the atria from the ventricles</li>
        </ul>
      <li>These valves open due to increased blood volume & pressure at the initial chamber</li>
        <ul>AV valves open when P<sub>atrial</sub> > P<sub>ventricular</sub></ul>
        <ul>Semilunar valves open when P<sub>ventricular</sub> > P<sub>pulmonary</sub> || P<sub>ventricular</sub> > P<sub>aortic</sub></ul>
    </ul>
