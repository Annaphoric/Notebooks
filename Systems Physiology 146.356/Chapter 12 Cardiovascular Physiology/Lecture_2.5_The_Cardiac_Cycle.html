    <h2>Lecture 2.5: The Cardiac Cycle</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Introduction</b>
      <li class="topic">The cardiac cycle consists of all the pressure changes, blood volume changes, electrical activity & heart sounds that occur in one complete heart beat. This process usually takes around 800ms</li>
      
      <br><li>There are 2 periods of interest that occur in a cardiac cycle: </li>
        <ul><b>Systole</b>
          <li>Refers to ventricular contraction</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Diastole</b>
          <li>Refers to ventricular relaxation</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><ol>One cardiac cycle consists of 5 more specific steps in order: </ol>
        <li>Late Ventricular Filling</li>
        <li>Isovolumetric Contraction</li>
        <li>Ventricular Ejection</li>
        <li>Isovoluemtric Relaxation</li>
        <li>Early Ventricular Filling</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Late Ventricular Filling</b>
      <li>This is the first step of the cardiac cycle which occurs towards the end of ventricular filling</li>
      <li>In this step: </li>
        <ul>Atrioventricular (AV) valves are open, allowing both the right & left ventricles fill with blood</ul>
        <ul>Semilunar valves are closed</ul>
        <ul>Atrial pressure is slightly higher than ventricular pressure, keeping the AV valves open</ul>
          <li>Ventricular pressure slowly increases as it fills with blood</li>
          <li>Although, the left ventricular pressure will always be higher than the right ventricular pressure</li>
        <ul>Aortic & pulmonary arterial pressure is slowly decreasing</ul>
        <ul>The SA node becomes depolarised right before the end of ventricular filling, causing atrial depolarisation & contraction and forming the P-wave</ul>
          <li>At this point, the ventricles finish filling. The current volume at this point in time is known as the <b>End Diastolic Volume</b> (EDV). This is the greatest volume that the ventricles can have</li>
        <ul>The AV valves close right before the next step, making the "lub" sound</ul>
        
      <br><li>Generally, the left & right atria are always filling with blood because there is no valve that regulates atrial blood volume</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Isovolumetric Contraction</b>
      <li>This is the second step of the cardiac cycle</li>
      <li>"Isovolumetric" means "no change" or "constant" "volume"</li>
      <li>In this step: </li>
        <ul>All valves are normally, fully closed to prevent backflow of blood and allowing blood volume in both atria & ventricles to remain constant</ul>
        <ul>Ventricles become depolarised while the atria are repolarising, forming the QRS-complex</ul>
        <ul>Ventricular pressure increases exponentially, becoming much higher than atrial pressure but still not as high as aortic until the end of contraction</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Ventricular Ejection</b>
      <li>This is the third step in the cardiac cycle</li>
      <li>In this step: </li>
        <ul>The ventricles finish contracting, forcing the semilunar valves to open</ul>
        <ul>Ventricular pressure as at its highest point, slightly higher than aortic pressure & much greater than atrial pressure</ul>
        <ul>Blood volume within the ventricles is rapidly decreasing because blood is being ejected through the semilunar valves, away from the heart. This continues until the ventricles reach a certain volume known as the <b>End Systolic Volume</b> (ESV). This is the lowest volume that the ventricles can have</ul>
        <ul>The ventricles repolarise towards the end of this phase, forming the T-wave</ul>
        <ul>The semilunar valves close right before the next step, making the "dub" sound</ul>
      
      <br><li>The volume witin the ventricles can never be zero; instead, ESV is around 40% of EDV. The amount of blood that left the heart is known as the <b>Stroke Volume</b> (SV). This is the difference between EDV & ESV</li>
        <li>An exact fraction or percentage of how much blood left the ventricles during this time relative to EDV is referred to as the <b>Ejection Fraction</b> (EF). This is calculated by the formula: EF = SV / EDV.</li>
          <ul>EF is around 55-65% at rest & 70-75% during exercise</ul>
          <ul>An EF of under 40% indicates heart failure</ul>
          <ul>An EF that is unusually, consistently high indicates enlarged ventricular muscle cells or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Isovolumetric Relaxation</b>
      <li>This is the fourth step of the cardiac cycle</li>
      <li>In this step: </li>
        <ul>All valves are normally, fully closed to prevent backflow to blood and allowing the blood volume in both the atria & ventricles to remain constant</ul>
        <ul>Ventricular pressure becomes lower than aortic presure but still higher than atrial pressure</ul>
        <ul>The ventricles finish repolarising</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Early Ventricular Filling</b>
      <li>This step is the early phase of the first step (or the last step)</li>
      <li>In this step: </li>
        <ul>The AV valves open, allowing the ventricles to fill with blood</ul>
        <ul>Blood volume exponentially moves towards EDV</ul>
          <li>If heart rate were to increase, the time it takes for the ventricles to fill with blood would be shortened</li>
        <ul>Ventricular pressure becomes lower than atrial pressure & much lower than aortic pressure</ul>
        <ul>This period of time marks the TP-interval</ul>
    </ul>
