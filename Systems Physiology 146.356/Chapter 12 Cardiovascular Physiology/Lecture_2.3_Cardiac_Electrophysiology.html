    <h2>Lecture 2.3: Cardiac Electrophysiology</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Cardiac Cells</b>
      <li>There are 2 main types of cardiac cells: </li>
        <ul><b>Electrical Conducting Cells</b>
          <li>Cells that are stimulated to create an electrical current throughout the heart</li>
          <li>Located in the SA (sinoatrial) node or AV (atrioventricular) node</li>
          <li>Contains a vestigial representation of a cardiac muscle cell, but itself does not contract</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Cardiomyocytes or Cardiac Muscle Cells</b>
          <li>Cells that contract rhythmically with every beat of the heart</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>Every cell is connected via gap junctions (for proper cell-to-cell communication using electrical synapses). Proteins that make up gap junctions are known as connexins</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Heart Innervation</b>
      <li>The heart is, in fact, able to beat without the intervention of nervous tissue, but the brain regulates the rate and pressure at which the heart beats. The heart has its own pacemaker and is capable of self-depolarisation</li>
      <li>There are 2 systems in which nervous tissue uses to innervate the heart: </li>
        <ul><b>Parasympathetic Nervous System</b>
          <li>Controlled by the vagus nerve (cranial nerve 10)</li>
          <li>When stimulated, a neuron from the vagus nerve releases acetylcholine for SA nodal cells (in the atria) to bind to. This causes an inhibitory response, slowing down heart rate.</li>
            <ul>The receptors located on SA nodal cells are metabotopic and muscarinic</ul>
            <ul>Specifically, the response causes a K<sup>+</sup> channels to open, hyperpolarising the cell</ul>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Sympathetic Nervous System</b>
          <li>Controlled by the thoracic spinal nerve</li>
          <li>When stimulated, a neuron from the thoracic spinal nerve releases epinephrine & norepinephrine for atrial & ventricular cells to bind to. This causes an excitatory response, increasing heart rate, heart contractility, and causing vasodilation of smooth muscle cells (mainly coronary arteries)</li>
            <ul>The receptors located on these cells are mostly β-adrenergic receptors which are metabotropic</ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>The Cardiac Conduction System</b>
      <ol>The sequence of cardiac excitation occurs in 4 steps: 
        <li>The SA node depolarises the right & left atria, causing contraction. This depolarisation occurs relatively quickly</li>
        <li>The AV node delays the depolarisation & excitation to let atria finish depolarising before the ventricles depolarises. This process links the voltage in the atria to the ventricles, matching them when the atria complete their depolarisation</li>
        <li>The AV bundle or bundle of His spreads the electrical signal to both the right & left ventricles. The interventricular septum is the first to depolarise within the ventricles. Then the apex & lateral walls of the heart depolarise. As the ventricles contract, the atria are relaxing & filling with blood</li>
        <li>The bundle branches or Purkinje fibers are the last to depolarise and terminate the electrical signal</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>In total, it takes around 800ms for one heart beat and cardiac electrical cycle to occur</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Ventricular Action Potentials</b>
      <li>Also referred to as the main cardiac action potentials</li>
      <li>These action potentials are very similar to atrial action potentials with the exception that ventricular APs are longer, due to slightly different channels & kinetics. Both occur only in cardiomyocytes</li>
      
      <br><ol>There are 5 distinct phases in a ventricular AP:
        <li>There exists a stable resting membrane potential (-90mV) which acts as a voltage baseline for cardiac cells. This is due to the abundant amount of open K<sup>+</sup> leak channels. This RMP is slightly more negative relative to skeletal sarcocytes & nerves</li>
        <li>After 300ms from the starting point, an upstroke or depolarisation is initiated where voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channel open (Na<sup>+</sup> ions enter the cell). These channels close rapidly after before leading to the next step</li>
        <li>After about 350ms from the starting point, a notch occurs where most Na<sup>+</sup> channels are already closed and repolarisation occurs. This leads to a transient/immediate opening of I<sub>to</sub> (current occuring transiently outward; K<sub>to</sub>) K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sup>+</sup> ions leave the cell). If these channels were defective, the AP would be elongated & there would be an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient inwards. This would also activate pathways that cause excessive hypertrophic growth in cardiac tissue (increase in tissue size via increase in cell size), leading to heart failure. These channels close very shortly after opening before leading to the next step. </li>
        <li>After about 400ms from the starting point, a plateau occurs where L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels open (Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions enter the cell while K<sup>+</sup> ions leave the cell). By now, the I<sub>to</sub> K<sup>+</sup> channels are already closed</li>
        <li>After about 600ms from the starting point, repolarisation occurs once again, but in this case, 2 types of rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels open. These channels are known as K<sub>r</sub> (rapid) & K<sub>s</sub> (slow) channels. If these channels were defective, the AP would also be elongated. This can lead to a condition know as QT syndrome. Shortly after repolarisation, the cell returns to its RMP (step 1) and the cycle continuously repeats</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Nodal Action Potentials</b>
      <li>This type of AP occurs only in nodal cells, including cells from the SA & AV node</li>
      <li>There is no steady resting membrane potential for nodal cells. The AP as a whole relative to its voltage appears to be sinusoidal. This fact is essential to the heart, as it allows for spontaneous depolarisation & the prevalence of a pacemaker potential</li>
      
      <br><ol>There are 3 distinct phases in a nodal AP:
        <li>There exists an unstable RMP due to open I<sub>f</sub> (funny current!) Na<sup>+</sup> channels. These channels are believably funny because they open at more relative hyperpolarised potentials (≈ -60mV) and have slower kinetics. These channels predominate in maintaining the RMP rather than K<sup>+</sup> channels</li>
        <li>After about 200ms from the starting point, a gradual upstroke or depolarisation occurs as 2 types of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels open (current flows inward as e<sup>-</sup> flow is outwards). These channels are the T-type (transient) Ca<sup>2+</sup> & L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels</li>
        <li>After about 400ms from the starting point, repolarisation occurs when rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels open, leading to K<sup>+</sup> efflux</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
