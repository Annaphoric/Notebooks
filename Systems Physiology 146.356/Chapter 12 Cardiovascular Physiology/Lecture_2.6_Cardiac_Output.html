    <h2>Lecture 2.6: Cardiac Output</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Introduction</b>
      <li><b>Cardiac Output</b> (CO) is the product of the heart rate (HR) in beats per minute & the stroke volume (SV) in liters</li>
      <li class="blue">CO measures the amount of blood that gets pumped out of the heart per minute</li>
      
      <br><li>On average at rest, heart rate is 72beats/min and stroke volume is 0.07L/beat. Therefore, the average cardiac output at rest is around 5.0L/min</li>
        <ul>During exercise, cardiac output can increase to around 25-35L/min</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Chronotropic Effects on Heart Rate</b>
      <li>Effects on the SA node cause a chronotropic effect or change in heart rate rhythm. These include parasympathetic & sympathetic effects: </li>
        <ul><b>Parasympathetic Effects</b>
          <li>The SA node inherit discharge rate is around 100bpm at rest. Since the true heart rate at rest is usually less than this, there must be a parasympathetic effect on the heart to decrease this rate</li>
          <li>These effects are caused by the vagus nerve (CN X) which act to lower the heart rate to 70-75bpm</li>
            <ul>This occurs by increasing K<sup>+</sup> permeability, leading to K<sup>+</sup> ion efflux, hyperpolarising the pacemaker cell, and decreasing its resting membrane potential</ul>
            <ul>Acetylcholine released by vagal neuronal cells regulate this permeability</ul>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Sympathetic Effects</b>
          <li>These effects are caused by the thoracic spinal nerve which act to increase heart rate</li>
            <ul>This occurs by increasing Na<sup>+</sup> funny channel permeability, leading to Na<sup>+</sup> influx, depolarising the pacemaker cell, and increasing its resting membrane potential</ul>
            <ul>Epinephrine & Norepinephrine released by thoracic spinal neuronal cells regulate this permeability</ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Dromotropic Effects on the Conduction System</b>
      <li>Effects on the rest of the conduction system (like AV node, AV bundle, bundle branches & Purkinje fibers) cause a dromotropic effect or change in the electrical conducting rate of the heart. These include parasympathetic & sympathetic effects: </li>
        <ul><b>Parasympathetic Effects</b>
          <li>Act to decrease overall conduction speed through the conduction system</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Sympathetic Effects</b>
          <li>Act to increase overall conduction speed through the conduction system</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Enotropic Effects on Stroke Volume</b>
      <li>There are 3 ways stroke volume is regulated inotropically: </li>
        <ul>EDV/preload regulation
          <li>EDV changes according to the <b>Frank-Starling Mechanism</b></li>
            <ul>If EDV increases, SV increases as well, but decreasing EDV does not always decrease SV</ul>
            <ul>The curve drawn when relating changes in SV to changes in EV is analogous to the length-tension curve of the heart. This is true because as the ventricles fill with blood towards EDV, the heart stretches and its length increases to accomodate the increase in volume. SV will be higher if ventricular tension is higher (there would be more actin-myosin bridges). In fact, there is a range optimal contractile lengths between actin & myosin which occurs at an EDV higher than resting</ul>
          <li>At rest, SV is normally 70mL when EDV is 130mL</li>
          
          <br><li>EDV also increases when <b>venous return</b> increases (the volume of blood filling up the atria from veins)</li>  
            
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul>Magnitude of sympathetic input to ventricles
          <li>This occurs by increasing cardiac contractility which will be explained afterwards in detail</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul>Afterload regulation
          <li>The afterload refers to the pressure of the arteries that the blood overcomes as it leaves the heart. It is also classified as the resistance of blood flow delivered to the aorta</li>
          <li>Normally, afterload does not affect stroke volume</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Sympathetic Effects on Cardiac Contractility</b>
      <li><b>Cardiac contractility</b> is the strength of cardiac contraction at any given EDV</li>
        <ul>It is mainly affected during an inotropic effect</ul>
        <ul>Contractility increases due to the effects of epinephrine & norepinephrine (sympathetic drive) by increasing SV at a given EDV. The time it takes for the contraction to occur is also shortened</ul>
      
      <br><ol>There are several steps in the cellular response to increase cardiac contractility: 
        <li>Norepinephrine or epinephrine binds to a β-adrenergic receptor located on a cardiomyocyte, activating it</li>
        <li>The β-adrenergic receptor detaches its α, β, & γ subunits. The α-subunit attaches to adenylyl cyclase which converts ATP to cAMP</li>
        <li>cAMP binds to a cAMP-dependent protein kinase, activating it and stimulates more L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> & ryanodine receptors to open by phosphorylating them. This causes an increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability and influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions both extracellularly & from the sarcoplasmic reticulum respectively. The protein kinase also phosphorylates troponin, increasing its dissociation rate with Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and shortening the rate of contraction. Additionally, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases are also phosphorylated, increasing their overall activity </li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
