    <h2>Lecture 2.4: The Electrocardiogram</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Introduction</b>
      <li class="blue">The electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is a graphical recording of the electrical activity of the heart. It only reads the depolarisation & repolarisation that occurs per cardiac cycle</li>
      
      <br><li>An ECG measures the sum of all the electrical activity (mainly atrial/ventricular action potentials) in the heart for every moment in time. The magnitudes of peaks & troughs shown in a normal ECG is dependent on the location of the <b>leads</b> (electrode pairs where the anode is (-) charged & the cathode is (+) charged). The direction of the lead always occurs from (-) -> (+) (demonstrating e<sup>-</sup> flow) where an anode is the reference electrode & the cathode is the recording electrode</li>
      
      <br><li>There are 3 main limb leads: </li>
        <ul><b>Lead I</b>
          <ul>Measured from an anode placed on the right wrist to a cathode placed on the left wrist</ul>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Lead II</b>
          <ul>Measured from an anode placed on the right wrist to a cathode placed on the left ankle</ul>
          <ul>Most accurately depicts an ECG graph</ul>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Lead III</b>
          <li>Measured from an anode placed on the left wrist to a cathode placed on the left ankle</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><li>A ground lead is also placed on the right ankle to act as a ground wire</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>The ECG Graph</b>
      <li>There are 3 distinct peaks of any ECG graph: </li>
        <ul><b>P-wave</b>
          <li>Represents atrial depolarisation</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>QRS-complex</b>
          <li>Represents ventricular depolarisation & atrial repolarisation simoultaneously</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>T-wave</b>
          <li>Represents ventricular repolarisation</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>Important regions of an ECG graph include: </li>
        <ul><b>PQ-Interval</b>
          <li>Respresents the activity between the P-wave & Q-trough</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>PR-Interval</b>
          <li>Represents the activity between the P-wave & the R-peak</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>QT-Interval</b>
          <li>Represents the activity between the Q-trough & the T-wave</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>ST-Segment</b>
          <li>Represents the activity between the S-trough & the T-wave</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>TP-Interval</b>
          <li>Represents the activity between the T-wave & the P-wave of the next cardiac cycle</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>RR-Interval</b>
          <li>Represents the activity between the R-peak to the R-peak of the next cardiac cycle</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>Various pieces of electrical information can be obtained by performing an ECG including: </li>
        <ul>Heart Rate
          <li>Measured as Rate = 60 / (R-R Interval)</li>
          <li>Diagnoses include normal heart rate, bradycardia (unusally slow heart rate) or tachycardia (unusually fast heart rate)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Cardiac Rhythm
          <li>Measured by observing the distances between subsequent RR-Intervals</li>
          <li>Diagnoses include normal rhythm, cardiac arrhythmias (unbalanced heart rhythmn), irregular heart beats, or cardiac ischemia (minor blockage of coronary arteries)</li>
          <ul>Note: Diagnoses usually require additional, follow-up tests</ul>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>Mechanical information like force or strength of the heart and blood volume cannot be determined using an ECG graph</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Cardiac Refractory Period</b>
      <li>This period occurs when the heart relaxes & fills with blood</li>
      <li>The absolute refractory period for cardiocytes is relatively long (â‰ˆ 250ms) compared to refractory periods of skeletal muscle, due to the presence of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current channels</li>
      
      <br><li>During this period, the heart cannot be excited again until the heart is fully relaxed (not in a contracted state)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Heart Abnormalities based on ECG Graph</b>
      <li>Types of heart abnormalities include: </li>
        <ul>An additional P-wave
          <li>Indicates AV nodal damage and a 2<sup>nd</sup> degree heart block</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Uncontrolled prevalence of peaks
          <li>Indicates ventricular fibrillation which requires a defibrillator or other immediate treatment in order to keep affected person alive</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Long QT-syndrome
          <li>Indicates prolonged ventricular APs due to loss of K<sub>r</sub>/K<sub>s</sub> expression</li>
          <li>This is a sign of an irregular heartbeat or cardiac arrhythmia</li>
          <li>In most cases, it is a congenital condition</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Elevated ST segment
          <li>May be associated with coronary ischemia, which indicates an increased risk of a myocardial infarction (MI; heart attack)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
