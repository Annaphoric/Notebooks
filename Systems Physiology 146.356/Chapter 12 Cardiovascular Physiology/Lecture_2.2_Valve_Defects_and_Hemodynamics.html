    <h2>Lecture 2.2: Valve Defects & Hemodynamics</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Valve Defects</b>
      <li>Valves located on the left side of the heart are more prone to defects due to a greater relative pressure than the right side</li>
      <li>Stenosis</li>
        <ul>Diagnosed when an abnormally narrow (stenotic) valve, causing <b>turbulent flow</b> (uncontrolled flow) of blood as it is pumped through the valve. The sounds this makes is clinically referred to as a heart murmur. Blood flow is normally <b>laminar</b> (controlled; parallel)</ul>
        <ul>Can be caused congenitally (hereditary) or Ca<sup>2+</sup> buildup over time</ul>
      
      <br><li>Insufficiency</li>
        <ul>Diagnosed when an insufficient or leaky valve that leaks when it is closed. This causes turbulent backflow and is also heard as a heart murmur</ul>
        <ul>Most common as a prolapse (backwards flip) of the AV valves due to chordinae tendinae (stringy papillary muscles that connect the valves to the heart walls)</ul>
        <ul>Less common is the prolapse of semilunar valves which regurgitates blood back into ventricles</ul>
        <ul>If the bicuspid valve does not fully close during ventricular ejection or isovolumetric relaxation, blood would leak into the left atrium & pulmonary veins. These phases are discussed further in the cardiac cycle lecture</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Hemodynamics</b>
      <li class="blue">The relationship between pressure, flow rate & resistance of blood flow in the cardiovascular system</li>
      
      <br><li>Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure exerted by any fluid like blood. The pressure is measured between 2 points of a blood vessel</li>
        <ul>This pressure is generated by the contraction of the heart (units -> mmHg)</ul>
      <li>Flow rate is the rate at which blood flows. It is directly affected by the pressure between 2 points in a vessel (units -> L/min)</li>
      <li>Resistance is the inertia of blood flow between 2 points in a vessel</li>
      
      <br><li>Blood flow F is directly proportional to the change in pressure (ΔP) but inversely proportional to the resistance R. It is given by the equation: </li>
        <ul class="red">F = ΔP / R</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Hydrostatic Pressure</b>
      <li>This pressure is measured by taking the difference of pressures between 2 points in a blood vessel, resulting in a change in pressure (ΔP)</li>
      <li>The positional pressures in veins are lower in veins than in the positional pressures in arteries. Although, the observed ΔP in both vessels are generally the same</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Resistance</b>
      <li>Cannot directly be measured, but is measured relative to 3 factors: </li>
        <ul><b>Viscosity of Blood</b>
          <li>The friction that arises from fluid molecules in motion (kinetic friction)</li>
          <li>Thicker fluids like honey or syrup have a greater viscosity than thinner fluids like H<sub>2</sub>O</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Length of Blood Vessels</b>
          <li>The higher the length, the greater the surface area (SA) of the vessel and the more physical contact made between the fluid and its stationary walls</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Radius of Blood Vessels</b>
          <li>The higher the radius, the greater SA of the vessel and the more physical contact made between the fluid and its stationary walls like the length</li>
        </ul>
      
      <li><b>Poiseuille's Law</b></li>
        <ul>The resistance R can be calculated given the length L & radius R of the vessel/tube and the viscosity n by applying the formula: 
          <li class="red">R = (8Ln) / (πr<sup>4</sup>)</li>
          <li>In the formula, 8/π is a constant and can be disregarded when comparing the resistance between 2 points in a vessel. Under normal conditions, the viscosity (and hematocrit) is constant throughout the entire journey of the blood flowing through the body. This means it can also be disregarded when determining ΔR. The length can also the observed at a constant value. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Taking into account constant factors, the equation can be reduced to: </ul>
          <li>R = 1/r<sup>4</sup></li>
        <ul>This emphasizes that R ∝ 1/r<sup>4</sup>
          <li>In other words, if the radius doubles (wider vessel), the resistance decreases by 16 times (much more fluid flow)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
