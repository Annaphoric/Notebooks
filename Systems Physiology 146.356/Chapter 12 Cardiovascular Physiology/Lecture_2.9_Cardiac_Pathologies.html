    <h2>Lecture 2.9: Cardiac Pathologies</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Hypertension</b>
      <li>Also referred to as high blood pressure</li>
      <li>Normal blood pressure for an individual is 120/80 (mmHg) (120 SP, 80 DP)</li>
      <li>High blood pressure is clinically characterised as having a BP of 140/90. Although recently, this value has been modified to 130/85, hinting further sales of hypertensive medications and/or earlier diagnoses or warning signs. A BP of 130/85 can also be defined as being in a pre-hypertensive state</li>
      <li>Research has shown that 34% of the US population and 26% of the world population is hypertensive</li>
      
      <br><li>An increase in afterload directly affects blood pressure proportionally</li>
      
      <br><li>Over time, hypertension can cause to left ventricular hypertrophy (growth of tissue in size), leading to a decrease in contractile function & an increased likelihood of heart failure</li>
      
      <br><li>There are 2 general types of hypertension: </li>
        <ul><b>Primary</b>
          <li>More common than secondary</li>
          <li>Characterised by an increase in total peripheral resistance due to a decrease of arteriole radius</li>
          <li>Causes include obesity, insulin resistance, increased dietary salt intake, frequent stimulation of sympathetic drive (stress), salt-water retention</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Secondary</b>
          <li>Less common than primary</li>
          <li>Characterised by high blood pressure due to non-cardiovascular factors like renal hypertension (kidney malfunction, leading to an increase in extracellular fluid volume)</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>Treatments include: </li>
        <ul><b>Diuretics</b>
          <li>Lowers blood volume & pressure by increasing amount of urine</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>β-blockers</b>
          <li>Decreases cardiac output by blocking β-adrenergic receptors on cardiomyocytes, acting as an adrenergic antagonist</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Ca<sup>2+</sup> Channel Blockers</b>
          <li>Induces vasodilation by decreasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in peripheral smooth muscle tissue, causing less contraction and decreasing TPR</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Heart Failure</b>
      <li>Also referred to as congestive heart failure or dysfunction</li>
      <li>Occurs when the heart does not pump an adequate amount of cardiac output. Baroreceptors also become desensitized to a change in BP, leading to a lower firing rate even when BP appears to be normal and resulting in a baroreceptor reflex which increases HR, TPR, sympathetic drive, ADH, aldosterone, BP</li>
        <ul>As aldosterone increases, the likelihood of pulmonary edema increases as well. Pulmonary edema is an adaptive response to a decrease in cardiac output, characterised by extracellular fluid buildup in the lungs & pulmonary vessels. Fluid retention also increases venous & capillary pressure</ul>
      
      <br><li>There are 2 types of heart failure: </li>
        <ul><b>Diastolic dysfunction</b>
          <li>Caused by chronic hypertension and high afterload</li>
          <li>The ventricle walls have a decreased compliance (or abnormal stiffness; thickening), causing the ventricle to not fill with blood properly. This results in a decreased EDV & SV (based on Frank-Starling's Law)</li>
          <li>To treat diastolic dysfunction, the hypertension is first treated</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Systolic dysfunction</b>
          <li>Caused by myocardial damage likely from a heart attack</li>
          <li>Characterised by a decrease in coronary blood flow. Heart contractility is also decreased, leading to a lower SV for a given EDV (decreased ejection fraction; EF)</li>
          <li>Can lead to further devastating heart attacks if not treated</li>
          <li>To treat systolic dysfunction, the hypertension is first treated. Cardiac output may also be increased by adrenergic agonistic drugs inotropically</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Hypertropic Cardiomyopathy</b>
      <li class="blue">An increase thickness of cardiomyocyte walls, especially in the interventricular septum & left ventricular wall</li>
      <li>Characterised by an increase in cardiac output despite an increase in workload, leading to chest pains & diastolic heart failure due to slight coronary blockage. Most of the times, hypertropic cardiomyopathy is genetic</li>
      
      <br><li>Studies have showed that there is a prevalence of 1 in 500 people and there is often no symptoms. There have been over 900 mutations in over 20 genes, including in myosin (specifically)</li>
      
      <br><li>Treatments include drugs that prevent arrythmias and calm the heart. Strenuous exercise is also discouraged. If pains persist or hypertrophy becomes too advanced, a heart transplant is necessary</li>
      
      <br><li>Generally hypertrophy is tissue growth due to an increase in cell size. There are 2 types of hypertrophy: </li>
        <ul><b>Concentric</b>
          <li>Characterised by wider cells, causing tissue to be thicker and with smaller cavities</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Eccentric</b>
          <li>Characterised by longer cells, causing tissue to be thinner and with larger cavities</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>There are 2 types of cardiac hypertrophy: </li>
        <ul><b>Physiological</b>
          <li>Occurs naturally through chronic exercise or pregnancy</li>
          <li>May result in enhanced cardiac function and slight chamber enlargement</li>
          <li>No fibrosis occurs and gene expression is normal</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Pathological</b>
          <li>Occurs through chronic hypertension, aortic stenosis (caused by aortic valve defect), or sarcomeric gene mutations</li>
          <li>Results in cardiac dysfunction, fibrosis, myocyte necrosis and apoptosis</li>
          <li>Associated with heart failure & increased mortality</li>
          <li>Can lead to cardiac dilation, heart failure & worsening symptoms if not treated</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Myocardial Infarction</b>
      <li>Also referred to as a heart attack</li>
      <li>Caused by advanced cardiac ischemia (lack of blood flow) in coronary arteries, leading to heart damage. Lack of blood flow can arise due to <b>plaque</b> buildup in arteries. Plaque can be made of cholesterol, lipids, smooth muscle and other tissue proliferating</li>
      
      <br><li>Symptoms include chest pain, the elevation of ST-segments in an EKG graph, and the prevalence of proteins like cardiac troponin in blood that shouldn't be there</li>
      
      <br><li>Research shows that 1.1 million Americans suffer from a heart attack (due to v-fib; uncoordinated contractions) every year, and 40% of those people do not survive</li>
      
      <br><li>MIs can be prevented by incorporating a healthy diet & exercise</li>
      <li>Treatments for cardiac ischemia include blood thinners, diuretics, and/or β-blockers. Surgery like coronary artery bypass (CABG; creates a new pathway to supply blood to heart tissue using another vessel in the body) or a balloon angioplasty (opens up the affected artery by adding a stent) may be required to reduce symptoms and minimise the likelihood of another MI</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Preventing Most Cardiac Dysfunctions with Exercise</b>
      <li>Exercise can: </li>
        <ul>Decrease heart O<sub>2</sub> demand by lowering resting HR</ul>
        <ul>Increase the radius of coronary arteries</ul>
        <ul>Decrease the severity of hypertension & diabetes</ul>
        <ul>Decrease total plasma cholesterol</ul>
        <ul>Decrease the likelihood of blood clots</ul>
        <ul>Increase insulin sensitivity, leading to better blood glucose concentration regulatio</ul>
      </ul>
