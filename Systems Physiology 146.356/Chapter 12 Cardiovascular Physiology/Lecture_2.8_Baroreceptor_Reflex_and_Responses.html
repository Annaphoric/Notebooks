    <h2>Lecture 2.8: Baroreceptor Reflex & Responses</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Baroreceptors</b>
      <li class="blue">Baroreceptors are pressure sensors located within the carotid arteries & the aortic arch</li>
      
      <br><li>Their action potential firing rate in performing a reflex depends on blood pressure</li>
        <ul>The higher the BP, the more likely the receptors will activate</ul>
      
      <br><li>In the case of a hemorrhage, blood volume, stroke volume & arterial blood pressure would decrease. This is a signal for baroreceptors to decrease their firing rate, making an attempt to increase blood pressure by decreasing parasympathetic discharge and increasing sympathetic discharge throughout the body</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul class="topic"><b>Cardiovascular Responses/Adaptations with Exercise</b>
        <li>As a result of endurance exercise, blood flow rate changes among different parts of the body</li>
          <ul>Compared to resting values, blood flow will decrease to the brain, kidneys, abdominal organs & other non-essential organs. Blood flow will increase slightly to the skin & heart and increase greatly to skeletal muscles</ul>
        
        <br><li>Mean arterial pressure, systolic (compliance) pressure, cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume and end-diastolic volume all increase during mild exercise. Diastolic (elasticity) pressure remains constant and total peripheral resistance decreases during mild exercise due to vasodilation</li>
        
        <br><li>Maximum heart rate is not affected by exercise, but rather, by age. Although, resting heart rate can be trained by exercise along with cardiac output. A trained athelete will naturally have a lower & more controlled heart rate at a given work rate compared to an sedentary individual</li>
        
        <br><li>V<sub>O<sub>2</sub>-max</sub> is the point during exercise where O<sub>2</sub> consumption fails to increase despite an increase in workload. Trained individuals can generally have a higher V<sub>O<sub>2</sub>-max</sub> & max stroke volume (due to a larger chamber size hypertrophically) than sedentary individuals</li>
          <ul>V<sub>O<sub>2</sub>-max</sub> is limited by cardiac output, O<sub>2</sub> delivery to the lungs during respiration, the muscles' ability to use O<sub>2</sub>, # of blood vessels in skeletal muscle, and heart rate, limiting the time it takes for the heart to fill with blood</ul>
      </ul>
