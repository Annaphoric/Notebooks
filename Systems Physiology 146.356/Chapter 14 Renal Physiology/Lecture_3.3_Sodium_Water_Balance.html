    <h2>Lecture 3.3: Balance of Sodium & Water</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Reabsorption within the Proximal Tubule</b>
      <li>Most of the H<sub>2</sub>O that gets filtered is also reabsorbed back into the blood</li>
      
      <br><li>On average, about 2.85L of water is excreted from our body everyday via skin + lungs (0.9L), sweat (50mL), feces (100mL) & urine (1.8L). This implies that we would also require an intake of the same amount of water to make up for the daily loss</li>
      
      <br><li>On average, a total amount of 8.5g of sodium is excreted from our body via sweat (250mg), feces (250mg), & urine (8g). This means the same amount is required from food</li>
      
      <br><li>Both Na<sup>+</sup> ions & H<sub>2</sub>O are filtered freely, highly reabsorbable, & not secreted. Much energy is required to reabsorb both of them. About 2/3 of reabsorption of sodium & water occurs in the PCT and the rest is hormonally controlled within the DCT & collecting duct</li>
      
      <br><li>Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption is active (requires energy) and occurs anywhere within the renal tubule except for the descending limb of the Loop of Henle</li>
      
      <br><li>H<sub>2</sub>O reabsorption is passive (does not require energy; via osmosis) and depends on Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Reabsorption of Sodium within the PCT</b>
      <li>There is a higher Na<sup>+</sup> concentration within the renal tubular lumen (fluid), interstitial fluid & peritubular capillary, but a lower concetration within a proximal tubular epithelial cell</li>
      
      <br><li>The apical membrane of a PCT epithelial cell is connected to the PCT while the basolateral membrane is facing towards the interstitial fluid and pointing towards a peritubular capillary. This gradient arises through the mechanism of Na-K pumps on the basolateral membrane. This is an active process. Sodium-cotransporters (also called <b>symports</b>) located on the apical membrane help transport other substances like glucose against their gradient into the cell as Na<sup>+</sup> ions travel along their gradient into the cell. This requires the active transport of sodium/potassium pumps; so, the symporters are considered to work as a secondary transport. Sodium-antitransporters (also called <b>antiports</b>) located on the apical membrane help transport substances like H<sup>+</sup> ions against their gradient out of the cell (secretion) as Na<sup>+</sup> ions travel along their gradient into the cell</li>
      
      <br><li>Organic molecules like glucose travel from the cell into the interstitial fluid passively via facilitated diffusion. Na<sup>+</sup> ions also travel from the cell into the interstitial fluid, but this occurs actively via sodium-potassium pumps. <b>Bulk flow</b> (measured in osmolarity or mOsm) of these substances drives them to enter the peritubular capillary (reabsorption)</li>
      
      <br><li>The amount of Na<sup>+</sup> ions excreted is equal to the amount of Na<sup>+</sup> filtered subtracted by the amount of Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorbed: </li>
        <ul>excreted = filtered - reabsorbed</ul>
        <ul class="green">Na<sup>+</sup> ions do not get secreted!</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Reabsorption of Water within the PCT</b>
      <li>H<sub>2</sub>O molecules requires a transporter known as <b>aquaporins</b> to passively cross the membrane (facilitated diffusion). Aquaporins are abundant on the PCT</li>
      
      <br><li>Passive transport of Na<sup>+</sup> ions into the cell from the tubular lumen decreases <b>local osmolarity</b> (pressure of substances relative to pressure of H<sub>2</sub>O). This drives H<sub>2</sub>O molecules to leave the tubular lumen into the cell via osmosis (water follows the solute) to attempt to achieve an equal osmolarity. H<sub>2</sub>O will then flow into the interstitial fluid and into the peritubular capillaries via bulk flow. Solutes do not follow water</li>
      
      <br><li>H<sub>2</sub>O reabsorption occurs independent of Na<sup>+</sup> ions in the collecting duct (CD). This occurs via the mechanism of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH; vasopressin). ADH stimulates the insertion of aquaporins into the apical membrane of epithelial CD cells via a signaling cascade</li>
        <ol>There are 6 steps in the mechanism of ADH: 
          <li>ADH secreted from the posterior pituitary gland binds to a metabotropic receptor on the basolateral membrane of an epithelial CD cell</li>
          <li>After a few intermediate steps, Adenylyl cyclase becomes activated, converting ATP into cAMP</li>
          <li>cAMP activates protein kinase-A (PKA)</li>
          <li>PKA phosphorylates proteins that increase the rate vesicle fusion onto Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in the apical membrane</li>
          <li>H<sub>2</sub>O is now able to flow through AQP2's from the renal tubular lumen into the epithlial CD cell</li>
          <li>H<sub>2</sub>O can now flow through AQP3 & AQP4 located on the basolateral membrane from the epithelial CD cell into the interstitial fluid and into the pertiubular capillary. These aquaporins permanently remain within the basolateral membrane</li>
        </ol>
      
      <br><li>ADH does not affect movement of solutes</li>
      
      <br><li>Liquor (alcohol) inhibits the release of ADH, causing more H<sub>2</sub>O to be excreted in the urine. Diabetes insipidus causes also down-regulates the release of ADH; individuals with this condition can excrete 25L of H<sub>2</sub>O per day</li>
    </ul>
