    <h2>Lecture 3.6: Water, Potassium & Acid-Base Regulation</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>ADH Regulation</b>
      <li>Antidiuretic hormone is regulated by <b>osmoreceptors</b> located in the hypothalamus</li>
        <ul>These receptors detect the osmolarity of body fluids. ADH directly affects H<sub>2</sub>O but indirectly affects Na<sup>+</sup></ul>
        <ul>It usually takes a noticeable drop in BP in order for ADH to be released as a response to low BP, like in the case of hemorrhage or diarrhea. An increase of ADH leads to an increase in BP</ul>
      
      <br><li>If excess water is consumed, blood plasma will have a lower osmolarity. This decreases the firing rate of hypothalamic osmoreceptors which leads to a decrease in ADH, less H<sub>2</sub>O reabsorption & more H<sub>2</sub>O excretion</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Potassium Regulation</b>
      <li>Changes in K<sup>+</sup> excretion are mainly due to changes in K<sup>+</sup> secretion in the distal tubule & cortical collecting ducts</li>
      <li>[K<sup>+</sup>] drives activity of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps. A low [K<sup>+</sup>] decreases its activity while a high [K<sup>+</sup>] increases its activity</li>
    
      <br><li>K<sup>+</sup> ions travel from the interstitial fluid into cortical CD cells via sodium/potassium pumps. Then, from the cells, the ions diffuse into the tubular lumen via leak channels</li>
      
      <br><li>Aldosterone also indirectly regulates K<sup>+</sup> concentration. Having a high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>extracellular</sub> (hyperkalemia) promotes aldosterone secretion which drives to increase K<sup>+</sup> secretion/excretion</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Acid-Base Regulation</b>
      <li>H<sup>+</sup> ions are generated and/or gained from: </li>
        <ul>The conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to carbonic acid</ul>
        <ul>A product of the metabolism of proteins and other organic molecules. This includes certain non-volatile acid products like lactid acid</ul>
        <ul>The loss of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (bicarbonate) ions as a result of diarrhea, urine, and pancreatic secetions</ul>
      
      <br><li>H<sup>+</sup> ions are used or lost from: </li>
        <ul>Being used as a reactant in various metabolic reactions</ul>
        <ul>Regurgitation or urine</ul>
        <ul>Hyperventilation</ul>
      
      <br><li>Carbonic acid dissociates into H<sup>+</sup> & HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions which regulates blood pH as a buffer</li>
        <ul>If H<sup>+</sup> ions are excreted in urine, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions are more likely to be reabsorbed into the blood plasma, allowing them to bind with H<sup>+</sup> ions in blood. This increases blood pH as a result</ul>
        <ul>If HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions are excreted in urine, H<sup>+</sup> ions are less likely to be secreted/excreted. This decreases blood pH as a result</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Acid-Base Related Disorders</b>
      <li>The following table will compare & contrast types of acidoses & alkaloses: </li>
      
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th></th><th>Metabolic Acidosis</th><th>Metabolic Alkalosis</th><th>Respiratory Acidosis</th><th>Respiratory Alkalosis</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Characterisations</th><td>low plasma pH; high [H<sup>+</sup>]; low [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>]</td><td>high plasma pH; low [H<Sup>+</Sup>]; high [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>]</td><td>increased [CO<sub>2</sub>]</td><td>decreased [CO<sub>2</sub>]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Causes</th><td>Excessive lactic acid buildup; untreated diabetes</td><td>Persistent vomiting; most uncommon out of the 4</td><td>COPD; sleep apnea; airway obstruction</td><td>Panic attacks; hyperventilation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Treatments/Compensations</th><td>Hyperventilation (releasing CO<sub>2</sub>); renal excretion of H<sup>+</sup>; renal reabsorption of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></td><td>Hypoventilation (intaking CO<sub>2</sub>); renal excretion of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>; less secretion/excretion of H<sup>+</sup></td><td>Same as metabolic acidosis</td><td>Same as metabolic alkalosis</td>
