    <h2>Lecture 3.4: The Countercurrent Multiplier System</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Generating Hypertonic Urine</b>
      <li>The concentration of solutes within the ascending limb of the loop of Henle exists at a set point of around 300mOsm. A solution containing less than 300mOsm would be considered <b>hypotonic</b> (dilute) and a solution containing greater than 300mOsm would be considered <b>hypertonic</b> (concentrated). Other sections of the loop of Henle follow a similar trend</li>
      
      <br><li>Since the ascending limb cannot contain aquaporins, it is impermeable to H<sub>2</sub>O. Contrarily, Na<sup>+</sup> & Cl<sup>-</sup> ions are able to actively be pumped out within this region. This increases the osmolarity of the interstitial fluid around the ascending limb as it becomes more concentrated with ions (hyper-osmotic) while the filtrate becomes less concentrated with ions (hypo-osmotic)</li>
        <ul>If the mechanism of pumping these ions out of the ascending limb were blocked by a loop-diuretic like Furosemide, H<sub>2</sub>O would remain in the collecting duct as there would be a much less gradient formed as a result. This causes urine to be dilute since H<sub>2</sub>O cannot leave the renal tubule. This can also be a treatment for hypertension
          <li>Loop diuretics specifically target <b>NKCC transporters</b> to inhibit them. These cotransporters are present on the apical membrane and allow one Na<sup>+</sup> ion & 2 Cl<sup>-</sup> ions to flow along their gradient and K<sup>+</sup> ions to flow against their gradient into the tubular ascending limb cell</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>Unlike the ascending limb, the descending limb contains many aquaporins, allowing H<sub>2</sub>O molecules to passively flow out of the tubule (highly permeable) and into the interstitial fluid surrounding the descending limb. Because of this, the osmolarity of the descending limb & the interstitial fluid around it are equal (iso-osmotic). This value must be higher than the osmolarity of the ascending limb. As the filtrate moves down the descending limb, osmolarity of the tubule increases until reaching the trough of the loop of Henle where the osmolarity is 1400mOsm. The osmlarity would then decrease as the filtrate moves up the ascending limb</li>
      
      <br><li>The purpose of the differences in osmolarity within different sections of the loop of Henle is to regulate the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O reabsorbed from the collecting duct via the mechanism of ADH</li>
      
      <br><li>At the cortical collecting duct (away from core of kidney), the osmolarity is 300mOsm. An interstitial gradient drives H<sub>2</sub>O to be reabsorbed out of the tubule (somewhat due to ADH).</li>
      
      <br><li>The <b>vasa recta</b> are the capillaries that surround the loop of Henle. They are close enough to the tubule to immediate reclaim the substances that flow out of the tubule, allowing the medullary interstitial fluid to remain appropriately concentrated</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>The Role of Urea in Concentrating Medullary Fluid</b>
      <li>Urea (another solute) contributes to the osmolarity of the medullary interstitial fluid</li>
      
      <br><li>Around 55% of urea is reabsorbed from the collecting duct to the interstitial fluid. Out of this %, 50% becomes re-filtered back into the tubule and 5% flows from the interstitial fluid and into the efferent arteriole. Some percentages of urea can also be reabsorbed from the PCT & DCT (50% & 30% respectively). Around 15% of urea filtered is excreted as urine</li>
      
      <br><li>The concentration of urea in the medullary interstitial fluid increases in the presence of ADH, assisting in H<sub>2</sub>O reabsorption and further concentrating the urine. The volume of the filtrate will also be lightly lower with ADH. Without ADH, the urine will be much less concentrated with solutes like urea due to more H<sub>2</sub>O excretion. The volume of the filtrate will also be slightly higher under this condition</li>
    </ul>
