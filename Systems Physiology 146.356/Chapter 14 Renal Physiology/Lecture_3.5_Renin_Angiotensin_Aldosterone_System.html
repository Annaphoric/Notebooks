    <h2>Lecture 3.5: Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Baroreceptors' Contribution to Blood Pressure Regulation in Kidneys</b>
      <li>Baroreceptors detect changes in pressure and helps regulate distribution of Na<sup>+</sup> ions</li>
        <ul>Na<sup>+</sup> ions are the main extracellular ion and contribute greatly to pressure and volume of a fluid
          <li>High [Na<sup>+</sup>] leads to high fluid volume while low [Na<sup>+</sup>] leads to ow fluid volume</li>
        </ul>

      <br><li>As blood pressure increases, baroreceptor firing rate also increases and vice versa. The kidney's response to the lack of baroreceptors firing (a decreased blood pressure) is to decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by constricting the afferent arteriole, causing less blood to be filtered and less Na<sup>+</sup> ions & H<sub>2</sub>O to be excreted. This attempts to increase blood pressure</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Aldosterone's Contribution to Blood Pressure Regulation in Kidneys</b>
      <li class="blue">Aldosterone is a steroid hormone released from the adrenal cortex that promotes Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption in the DCT & CD</li>
        <ul>Since it is a steroid hormone, its effects occur slower than ADH</ul>
        <ul>Aldosterone does this by inducing the synthesis of ion channels & pumps that transport Na<sup>+</sup> ions into interstitial fluid from the cortical DCT/CD epithelial cells and into the DCT/CD cells from the tubular lumen. These proteins include sodium-potassium pumps and Na<sup>+</sup> & K<sup>+</sup> leak channels</ul>
        <ul>As a result, blood pressure increases due to more Na<sup>+</sup> retention and therefore H<sub>2</sub>O concentration</ul>
      
      <br><li>The secretion of aldosterone is regulated by the Renin-Angiotensin-Alosterone System (RAAS)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System</b>
      <li>A signaling cascade that promotes the release of aldosterone as a result of low blood pressure</li>
      
      <br><ol>This system occurs in 4 main steps: 
        <li>Excess <b>angiotensinogen</b> (a protein consisting of 453 residues) is released from the liver</li>
        <li>The enzyme <b>renin</b> secreted by juxtaglomerular cells catalyses the conversion of angiotensinogen to <b>angiotensin I</b> (a protein consisting of 10 residues) which is biologically inactive. This catalysis is the rate-limiting (slow) step</li>
        <li>Excess <b>Angiotensin-converting enzyme</b> (ACE) secreted by capillary endothelial cells catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I into <b>angiotensin II</b> (a protein consisting of 8 residues) which is biologically active</li>
        <li>Angiotensin II increases aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex and promotes systemic vasoconstriction of arteries & arterioles, increasing blood pressure</li>
      </ol>
      
      <br><li>Renin is stimulated by 3 factors: </li>
        <ul>Renal sympathetic nerves
          <li>An increase in sympathetic drive or stress directly innervates juxtaglomerular cells (via synapses) to release renin</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Intrarenal baroreceptors
          <li>These baroreceptors are the juxtaglomerular cells themselves</li>
          <li>The less stretched the afferent arteriole (under a lower pressure) is, the more renin secreted</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Macula densa
          <li>Detect Na<sup>+</sup> concentration within the tubular lumen and communicate with juxtaglomerular cells. A lower [Na<sup>+</sup>] leads to more renin secretion</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Drugs that Manipulate RAAS</b>
      <li>The following drugs can all treat hypertension. These drugs include: </li>
        <ul><b>Lisnopril</b>
          <li>An ACE inhibitor</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Losartan</b>
          <li>An angiotensin II receptor blocker</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Eplerenone</b>
          <li>An aldosterone receptor blocker</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Atrial Natriuretic Peptide</b>
      <li>Abbreviated as ANP</li>
      
      <br><li>Secreted by cardiac atrial cells in response atrial distension via high blood volume</li>
      
      <br><li>Inhibits Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption at several sections of the renal tubule and increases GFR by dilating the afferent arteriole and constricting the efferent arteriole. This results in a decrease in BP</li>
    </ul>
