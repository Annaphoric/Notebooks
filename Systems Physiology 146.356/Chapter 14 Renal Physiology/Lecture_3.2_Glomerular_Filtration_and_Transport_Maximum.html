    <h2>Lecture 3.2: Glomerular Filtration and Transport Maximum</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Glomerular Filtration</b>
      <li>The kidneys are able to filter all 5L of blood 60 times per day</li>
      
      <li>Filtration is not selective; as long as the molecule is small, it can be filtered through the capillary wall and into the renal corpuscle, regardless if it would be reabsorbed</li>
      
      <br><li>There are 3 forces involved in the filtration of blood within glomerular capillaries: </li>
        <ul><b>Glomerular Capillary Pressure (P<sub>GC</sub>)</b>
          <li>A type of hydrostatic pressure, exerted by blood in the capillaries</li>
          <li>Favours filtration or the movement of substances from the blood into the renal corpuscle</li>
          <li>Around 60mmHg</li>
        </ul>
        <br><ul><b>Bowman's Space Pressure (P<sub>BS</sub>)</b>
          <li>Another type of hydrostatic pressure, exerted by the fluid with the renal corpuscle</li>
          <li>Against filtration</li>
          <li>Around 15mmHg</li>
        </ul>
        <br><ul><b>Plasma Protein Pressure (Ï€<sub>GC</sub>)</b>
          <li>A type of osmotic pressure, exerted by H<sub>2</sub>O within the renal corpuscle to withstand the pressure delivered by plasma proteins in the capillaries</li>
          <li>Against filtration</li>
          <li>Around 29mmHg</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>There is a net pressure of 16mmHg that favours filtration</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)</b>
      <li class="blue">The rate at which a volume of fluid becomes filtered from the glomerular capillaries into the renal corpuscle</li>
      <li>GFR is determined by 3 factors: </li>
        <ul><b>Net Filtration Pressure</b>
          <li>The 3 types of pressure are mentioned above</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Permeability of corpuscular membrane</b>
          <li>Based on the surface area available in the renal corpuscle for filtration</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Radius of Renal Arterioles</b>
          <li>Vasodilation of afferent arterioles and vasoconstriction of efferent arterioles increase GFR</li>
            <ul>The parasympathetic nervous system drives this to occur</ul>
            <ul>Caffeine has also been shown to promote vasodilation of afferent arterioles via adenosine</ul>
          <li>Vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles and vasodilation of efferent arterioles decrease GFR</li>
            <ul>The sympathetic nervous system drives this to occur</ul>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>The following chart demostrates the amounts that different substances are filtered and excreted: </li>
      
      <br><table>
        <tr>
          <th>Substance</th><th>Amount Filtered per Day</th><th>Amount Excreted per Day</th><th>Percentage Reabsorbed</th>
        <tr>
        <tr>
          <td>H<sub>2</sub>O</td><td>180L</td><td>1.8L</td><td>99%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Na<sup>+</sup> ions</td><td>630g</td><td>3.2g</td><td>99.5%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Glucose</td><td>180g</td><td>0g</td><td>100%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Urea</td><td>54g</td><td>30g</td><td>44%</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      
      <br><li>This table shows that most of the water and sodium that is filtered within the kidneys is reabsorbed back into the blood. All glucose should the reabsorbed</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Glucose Reabsorption</b>
      <li>Glucose reabsorption occurs within the proximal convoluted tubule. There are plenty of receptors located on epithelial cells connecting to the renal tubule. These receptors transport all glucose molecules from the filtrate into the peritubular capillaries</li>
      
      <br><li><b>Transport Maximum</b></li>
        <ul class="blue">The max amount of material that can be transported per unit time</ul>
        <ul>The average transport maximum (T<sub>max</sub>) for glucose is 300-350mg/min. Although, the actual rate depends on the type of nephron and can vary</ul>
        
        <br><ul>Normally, the amount of glucose reabsorbed is around 120mg/min at a concentration of 10mg/L. If excess glucose becomes present within the flitrate, not all glucose is able to be reabsorb and instead, will be excreted. This would occur at glucose T<sub>max</sub> at a threshold concentration of 25mg/L </ul>
    </ul>
