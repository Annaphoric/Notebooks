    <h2>Lecture 3.1: Introduction to Renal Physiology</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Introduction</b>
      <li>The urinary system, specifically the kidneys, is able to: </li>
        <ul>Filter blood to make urine</ul>
        <ul>Regulate H<sub>2</sub>O, ion & acid-base balance</ul>
        <ul>Excrete metabolic wastes & foreign materials</ul>
        <ul>Few hormones can be synthesized within the kidneys</ul>
      
      <br><li>The 2 kidneys are retroperotineal (posterior, medial and mid-transverse) and are connected to the bladder via a ureter. Urine is collected in the bladder & excreted through the urethra</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Nephron</b>
      <li class="blue">The main functional unit of the kidneys</li>
      
      <li>There are approximately 1 million nephrons per kidney</li>
      
      <br><li>Every nephron contains <b>renal corpuscles</b> (globular structures containing many capillaries) & <b>renal tubules</b> (tubes of different radii connecting to another relevant structure). Both of these structures are located within the renal cortex</li>
        <ul><b>Renal corpuscle</b>
          <li>Also referred to as the Bowman's Capsule</li>
          <li>Blood flows into this structure via an <b>afferent arteriole</b> (branching from the renal artery)</li>
            <ul>This arteriole is surrounded by <b>juxtaglomerular cells</b> (JG cells), which secrete a hormone known a renin</ul>
          <li>Within the corpuscle lies glomerular capillaries separated by a space known as Bowman's space. A renal tubule also initiates from the renal corpuscle</li>
          
          <br><li>Most of the blood (80%) that enters the capillaries exits via an <b>efferent arteriole</b>, leading to peritubular capillaries. Substances like H<sub>2</sub>O, electrolytes (ions), vitamins, small macromolecules, & small Nitrogen-containing compounds (large structures like RBCs and plasma proteins remain within the circulation) located in the blood within the glomerular capillaries may pass through the capillaries and into the Bowman's space (20% of blood), partially filtering the blood. These capillaries are classified as <b>fenestrated</b>, meaning they are relatively more porous than other capillaries</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Renal tubule</b>
          <li>Consists of many subsections that initiate from a renal corpuscle & terminate at a collecting duct</li>
          <li>The first section of a renal tubule (right after the corpuscle) is the <b>proximal convoluted tubule</b> (PCT; proximal tubule). The following sections are in order: descending limb, loop of Henle, ascending limb, <b>distal convoluted tubule</b> (DCT; distal tubule), and finally the collecting duct, leading to the ureter (outside the kidney)</li>
          
          <br><li>There are plenty of <b>peritubular capillaries</b> and some peritubular veins + arteries surrounding the sections of a renal tubule. These capillaries accept the filtrate, reabsorbing certain substances back into the blood</li>
          
          <br><li>The amount of fluid excreted is the sum of the fluid filtered & secreted subtracted by the amount of fluid reabsorbed: </li>
            <ul>excreted = (filtered + secreted) - reabsorbed</ul>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>There are 2 types of nephrons: </li>
        <ul><b>Cortical</b>
          <li>Around 85% abundant in humans</li>
          <li>Its loop of Henle is small and the bulk of the renal tubule lies within the renal cortex (outer region of the kidney)</li>
          <li>Not significantly involved in generating an osmotic gradient</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Juxtamedullary</b>
          <li>Only 15% abundant in humans</li>
          <li>Its loop of Henle is long and the bulk of the ascending & descending limbs are situated within the renal medulla (core of kidney)</li>
          <li>Surrounded by a special type of peritubular capillaries known as <b>vasa recta</b></li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul>In both, the distal tubule (DCT) always makes contact with the renal corpuscle before reaching the collecting duct. The cells located at the beginning of the distal tubule are known as <b>Macula densa</b>. Mesangial cells also lie superior to the DCT
          <li>The main role of macula densa is to detect [Na<sup>+</sup>] of the filtrate</li>
          <li>Most secretion also occurs from the peritubular capillaries into the DCT or collecting duct. This includes substances like H<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> ions</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Kidney Stones</b>
      <li>Clinically referred to as Renal Lithiasis</li>
      <li>Most kidney stones are made of Calcium oxalate or Calcium phosphate; however, they can also be made of deposits of any substance that can be filtered by the nephron. The likelihood of kidney stone formation increases if H<sub>2</sub>O intake is low</li>
      
      <br><li>These stones can be found within the ureter or in the bladder</li>
      
      <br><li>Treatments include drinking water, taking Î±-blockers (which functions as an adrenergic antagonist; relaxes the smooth muscles of the ureters)</li>
    </ul>
