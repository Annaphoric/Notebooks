    <h2>Lecture 4.2: COVID-19</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Viruses</b>
      <li class="blue">Viruses are infectious particles containing genetic material encapsulated by peptides and may even have lipid membrane</li>
        <ul>Their genetic material may be double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)</ul>
        <ul>The genetic material is surrounded by many small protein molecules known as <b>capsomeres</b> which make up the <b>capsid</b></ul>
        <ul>Many viruses, but not all, have a lipid membrane known as a <b>lipid envelope</b>. They may also have glycoproteins which act as ligands to bind to a host's specific receptor</ul>
        <ul>They lack many organelles that prokaryotes and/or eukaryotes have</ul>
      
      <br><li>They are not considered alive by many biologists since they cannot reproduce on their own or metabolise, but this is debatable</li>
      
      <br><ol>How an virus invades a host cell: 
        <li>When a virus finds a cell to invade, it attaches its glyocoprotein onto a receptor, releases its lipid envelope & endocytotically enters the cell</li>
        <li>The virus releases it genetic material into the cell which becomes incorporated into the host cell's DNA</li>
        <li>At the appropriate time, the host's enzymes replicates, transcribes, and translates the viral DNA, forming new viral components</li>
        <li>The viral components assemble to create many new viruses</li>
        <li>The viruses forcibly leaves the cell, causing it to lyse</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Coronaviruses</b>
      <li>Coronaviruses are ssRNA viruses that have nucleocapsid proteins, a lipid envelope, envelope proteins, membrane glycoproteins & spike proteins</li>
      
      <br><li>"Corona" comes from the crown-like appearance under an electron microscope</li>
      
      <br><li>Their genome encodes for proteins that are responsible for host infection, membrane fusion, viral assembly, RNA to DNA conversion (reverse transcriptase) and so on</li>
      
      <br><li>Their spike proteins protrude from the lipid envelope. They facilitate viral entry by recognising a host cell</li>
        <ul>The spike protein (S protein) is a transmembrane, clove-shaped protein divided into 3 segments:
          <li><b>S1 subunit</b> or the large ectodomain</li>
            <ul>Contains the globular receptor-binding domain (RBD) and membrane fusion subunit (S2)</ul>
          <li>Single pass transmembrane</li>
          <li>Intracellular tail</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>SARS-CoV-2</b>
      <li>The novel coronavirus first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. As of right now (December 2020; a year later), this virus has rapidly spread to almost every region of the world, causing the global pandemic of <b>COVID-19</b></li>
      
      <br><li>This virus binds to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) found on various types of cells. Specifically, the RBD of the spike glycoprotein binds to the non-catalytic (non-functional) side of the ACE2 receptor</li>
        <ul>Typically, the response to binding to this receptor involves RAAS. As mentioned in the endocrinology chapter, RAAS initiates with angiotensinogen. This protein is cleaved by renin into angiotensin I (1-10). Then, ACE converts Angiotensin I into Angiotension II (1-8). Angiotensin II binds to AT-1 receptors, which results in an increase in BP, enhanced systemic vasoconstriction, hypertrophy, & pro-inflammatory effects</ul>
        <ul>It was recently discovered that ACE2 is able to convert Angiotensin I to Angiotensin 1-9 and/or Angiotensin II to Angiotensin 1-7. Angiotensin 1-9 can be converted to Angiotensin 1-7. Angiotensin 1-7 beings to Mas receptors, which results in antagonist effects as in RAAS</ul>
        <ul>ACE2 is most in nearly every organ but is most abundant in type II alveolar cells, and somewhat  in the oral & nasal cavities</ul>
        
        <br><li>Physiological Host Responses include (mild or moderate; occurs 80% of cases): </li>
          <ul>Viral entry and early responses
            <li>Infects a target cell via ACE2 and TMPRSS2</li>
            <li>Actively replicates and releases more viruses via pyroptosis (a type of apoptosis)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <br><ul>Host immune responses
            <li>Clears and recruits macrophages & dendritic cells, then cytotoxic T-cells</li>
            <li>Recognises DAMPs and PAMPs</li>
            <li>Promotes inflammatory effects by releasing cytokines & chemokines</li>
            <li>Eliminates other infected cells</li>
          </ul>
        
        <br><li>Pathogenic Host Responses include (severe; 20% of cases): </li>
          <ul>Hyperinflammatory Phase
            <li>Induces a <b>cytokine storm</b> (a systemic overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines) involving the release of IL-6, IL-10, IL-2, IP-10, G-CSF, IFNy, TNF (Tumor necrosis factor), & M1P1a</li>
            <li>Excessively infiltrates immune cells within the lungs</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>Multi-organ Dysfunction
            <li>Leads to extra-pulmonary involvement (organ failure)</li>
            <li>Elicits a procoagulant response (excessive clotting; DIC)</li>
          </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul><b>Systemic Effects of COVID-19</b>
      <li>Regarding the nervous system: </li>
        <ul>50% of severe patients suffer from a complication in this system</ul>
        <ul>Milder complications are more common
          <li>They include gustatory & olfactory (taste & smell) dysfunctions due to direct epithelial damage</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>There is evidence that COVID-19 invades the brain, most likely due to hypoxia</ul>
      
      <br><li>Regarding the cardiovascular system: </li>
        <ul>Hypercoagulation is common in severe patients due to excessive inflammatory effects. This involves excessive production or activity for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and fibrinogen to fibrin</ul>
        <ul>There is an elevation of plasma cardiac troponin, which is normally an indication of a heart attack. Although, the elevation is due to excessive release of cytokines rather than myocardial damage</ul>
      
      <br><li>Regarding the renal system: </li>
        <ul>Proteinuria may occur in severe patients due to tubular necrosis at the filtration membrane</ul>
        
      <br><li>Regarding the digestive system: </li>
        <ul>There is an elevation of liver enzymes, indicating liver damage and/or inflammation</ul>
        <ul>May induce acute diabetes, indicating exocrine panreatic injury</ul>
        <ul>Intestinal enterocytes may also become infected</ul>
      
      <br><li>Regarding the reproductive system: </li>
        <ul>When comparing pregnant women to non-pregnant women, there appears no difference in mortality rate</ul>
        <ul>When comparing males to females, females are less susceptible to COVID-19 infection and effects than men. This infers that estrogen may cause a lower expression of ACE2 receptors, giving females slightly more protection</ul>
    </ul>
