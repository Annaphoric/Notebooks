    <h2>Lecture 4.4: The Physiology of Sex and Orgasm</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>The Male Sexual Response</b>
      <li>A common mneumoic is "point & shoot"; point for parasympathetic (erection) and shoot for sympathetic (ejaculation)</li>
      
      <br><li>An <b>erection</b> is the dilation of small arteries in the penis. The penis is divided into 3 vascular components that are normally vasocontricted (flaccid), but dilate (increasing pressure) during a sexual experience. During a sexual experience, parasympathetic neurons release nitric oxide which dilate arteries & compress veins. Tactile neurons (stimulated by touch; mechanoreceptors) can also facilitate vasodilation of arteries whilst sympathetic neurons inhibit it</li>
      
      <br><li><b>Ejaculation</b> is the spinal reflex mediated by afferent (sensory) pathways from penile mechoreceptors. There are 2 phases in ejaculation: </li>
        <ul>Smooth muscle contraction of epididymis, vas deferens, prostate gland and so on as a result of sympathetic drive. This causes the emptying of fluids within these glands & sperm into the vas deferens</ul>
        <ul>About an average of 3mL of semen is expelled via rapid contractions of urethral smooth muscle & skeletal muscle located at the bas of the penis containing 300 million sperm (10<sup>8</sup> sperm/mL). A sperm count of 25 million/mL is considered infertile</ul>
      
      <br><li>A male orgasm is defined as intense pleasure & rhythmic muscle contractions during ejaculation. Contraction of skeletal muscle in various parts of the body and a transient (quick) increase in HR & BP occurs</li>
      
      <br><li>After ejaculation, there is a latent period where a second erection cannot occur</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>The Female Sexual Response</b>
      <li>Unlike males, there are no set phases of a female sexual response</li>
      
      <br><li>During female arousal, there is an increase in muscle contraction and blood flow in various parts of the body. Some areas include breasts, vagina and clitoris. There is also erection of the nipples due to contraction of smooth muscle fibres and increased mucus lubrication in vaginal epithelial cells</li>
      
      <br><li>A female orgasm is defined as an increase in muscle contractions in the vagina, uterus, and other parts of the body. Unlike males, female orgasms do not have to occur for fertilisation to occur</li>
      
      <br><li>Sexual desire is mediated by androgens (precursors of estrogen), rather than estrogen itself</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Orgasm</b>
      <li>An <b>orgasm</b>is the primitive reflex to discharge gametes and stimulate sexual activity. This became advantageous as ferilisation moved from external to internal, which lead to a decrease in reproduction rates. Since the ability to reproduce is essential for the survival of a species, orgasms became the mechanism in which reproduction became more selective</li>
      
      <br><li>In females, orgasm is a post-copulatory (after sexual experience) selective tactic by which they can increase their control of mates</li>
      
      <br><li>All animals have the physiological capacity to orgasm</li>
      
      <br><li>During orgasm, various neuropeptides like dopamine, oxytocin & prolactin are released. These hormones collectively give a deep sense of well-being by activating the reward circuit. Some say it feels like the relief of a sneeze reflex, but at a larger scale</li>
      <li>In females, it also favours the persistence of mutual bonds to ensure best care for offspring</li>
      
      <br><li>In monkeys, females that mated with the highest ranking (most dominant) males showed the highest frequency of orgasms</li>
      
      <br><li>There is speculation that female orgasms promote better fertilisation, but has not yet been proven</li>
      
      <br><li>There are 2 types of fertilisation: </li>
        <ul>Internal Fertilisation
          <li>Consists of sperm uniting with the egg within the mother</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul>External Fertilisation
          <li>Consists of sperm uniting with the egg laid outside of the mother</li>
          <li>In teleost fish, the number of eggs laid can be controlled and a "false orgasm" is presented to manipulate males for sex</li>
          <li>Ovarian fluids play a role in sperm selection and provide gamete recognition proteins for fertilisation to occur within same species (avoid inbreeding). This also allows females to assess the quality of a partner</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Sexual Activity Rhythm</b>
      <li>Optimal sexual interaction involves modulating activity based on cues ranging from movements, vocal signals and subtle patterns of emotional expression</li>
      
      <br><li>Adept sensorimotor qualities and sensitivity of social and/or psychological intelligence also faciliates with sexual experiences</li>
      
      <br><li>In nature, a precise & rhythmic pattern during mating is an indication of a good quality of orgasm. Examples include a bird's song and courtship of invertebrates</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Orgasmic Dysfunction</b>
      <li>About 11-41% of women have difficulty experiencing orgasm. This is usually correlated with underlying health problems like diabetes, depression, stress, poor self-esteem. Age & medications also affect quality of orgasm</li>
      
      <br><li>Cognitive behaviourial therapy (CBT) and/or sex therapy may help guide a female to coping with sexual experiences</li>
      
      <br><li>Estrogen or testosterone replacement therapy may also help in achieving orgasm</li>
      <li>Arousal oils may help but may be a risk to use</li>
    </ul>
