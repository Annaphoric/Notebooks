    <h2>Lecture 4.1: Diabetes</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Insulin Mechanism</b>
      <li><b>Insulin</b> is a peptide hormone released by β-pancreatic cells (a type of Islet of Langerhans cell)</li>
      
      <br><li>Its main goal is to lower blood sugar after a meal</li>
      <li>Insulin targets receptors located on muscle cells, fat cells & liver cells. Each one of these organs can store fat. The effects that insulin has on one of these individual types of cells is slightly different from each other</li>
        <ul>In sarcocytes, insulin increases glucose uptake & utilisation. It also increases net glycogen & protein synthesis and net amino acid uptake</ul>
        <ul>In adipocytes, insulin increases glucose uptake & utilisation. It also increases net triglyceride synthesis</ul>
        <ul>In liver cells, insulin increases the rate of gluconeogenesis. It also increases net glycogen, & triglyceride synthesis</ul>
      
      <br><ol>There are several steps to the mechanism of insulin: 
        <li>Insulin binds to a metabotropic receptor on a target cell</li>
        <li>A signal transduction pathway is stimulated and causes cytoplasmic vesicles to insert <b>GLUT-4 transporters</b> (insulin dependent trasporters present in fat & muscle cells used to uptake glucose; although, they are not insulin dependent within neurons) into the plasma membrane. Their expression (translation) is also increased</li>
        <li>There is an increase in glucose intake via facilitated diffusion through the GLUT-4 receptors</li>
        
        <br><li>The stimulus for β-pancreatic cells to release insulin is a higher than normal blood glucose concenration. Increased amino acid concentrations & a parasympathetic drive can also cause insulin release. <b>Incretins</b> (hormones secreted by enteroendocrine cells) like GLP-1 and GIP are also able to amplify the effect of insulin before stimulation</li>
        
        <br><li>During prolonged exercise (over 90 consistent minutes), the liver begins to perform glycogenolysis & gluconeogenesis to increase available blood glucose that has been used. Eventually, the liver cannot keep up with glucose release and <b>glucagon</b> (antagonist to insulin) secretion via α-pancreatic cells will be increased. Glucagon is stimulated by sympathetic drive. Muscle contraction also promotes GLUT transporter migration, synthesis & expression. During exercise, muscles do not require as much insulin as they do at rest</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Diabetes Mellitus</b>
      <li>Diabetes is characterised by decreased uptake of glucose from the blood into cells</li>
      
      <br><li>There are 2 forms of diabetes mellitus: </li>
        <ul><b>Type I</b>
          <li>Also referred to as juvenile-onset diabetes since it is usually diagnosed at a young age</li>
          <li>Characterised by insulin secretion deficiency</li>
          <li>Only makes up 5% of all diabetes cases</li>
          <li>Treatments include insulin injections</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Type II</b>
          <li>Also referred to as adult-onset diabetes since it usually occurs in adults</li>
          <li>Characterised by cellular insensitivity (target cell hypo-responsiveness) to insulin or the response to an increase in blood glucose is impaired. This may be due to having too much fat in muscle cells</li>
          <li>Makes up about 95% of cases which are correlated with obesity</li>
          <li>Treatments vary depending on severity of diabetes. Some include: possible insulin injections, drugs that increase cell sensitivity to insulin, or decrease liver glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis like metformin. The primarily treatment is exercise because it increases GLUT receptors on the membrane without the need for insulin</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>Insulin deficiency causes a decreased uptake of glucose by cells and increased glycogenolysis & gluconeogenesis, leading to an increased blood glucose concentration. Eventually, there will be an increased renal filtration of glucose & ketones (due to breakdown of fatty acids or lipolysis). This induces osmotic diuresis which increases Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O excretion and decreases blood volume, blood pressure, and brain blood flow. Decreased brain blood flow leads to impaired brain function and possibly coma or death. <b>Diabetic ketoacidosis</b> (metabolic acidosis) can also occur, which is an abnormal increase in [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>plasma</sub> and decreased pH</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Gestational Diabetes</b>
      <li>Prolonged maternal hyperglycemia may lead to fetal hyperglycemia. Since maternal insulin cannot cross the placenta, the fetus must produce its own insulin. In the case of gestational diabetes, there will be an overproduction of fetal insulin, causing an abnormal increase in fetal organ size & body mass since insulin acts as a growth factor. As a result, the pregnant mother would require a C-section</li>
    </ul>
