    <h2>Lecture 4.3: Links between Mental & Physical Health and the Gut Microbiome</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Mental Health</b>
      <li class="blue">Defined by the WHO, the state of well-being where an individual realises their own abilities can cope with the normal stresses of life, work productively & fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to society. This ranges from low to high quality</li>
      
      <br><li><b>Depression</b></li>
        <ul>Characterised by a persistent depressed mood or loss of interest in activities</ul>
        <ul>As of 2020, 7% of US adults suffer from depression</ul>
        <ul>Diagnosed in an individual if the depression is causing significant impairment in their daily life</ul>
        <ul>It is found that individuals with depression have a smaller <b>hippocampus</b> which is the part of the brain associated with memory. Stress can suppress neuronal growth within the hippocampus</ul>
        <ul>More severe cases are correlated with in an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and HPA axis overactivity (overstimulation of the adrenal gland to produce cortisol)</ul>
        <ul>Depression may be caused by hereditary factors, hypothyroidism, and/or stressful life events</ul>
        <ul>Treatments include anti-depressants which act as serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Post-synaptic neuronal excitation allows for the growth and repair of neurons, especially in the hippocampus. Treatments for more severe cases include medications that decrease HPA axis activation and an inflammatory response</ul>
        
      
      <br><li><b>Anxiety</b></li>
        <ul>Characterised by persistent feelings of worry, anxiety and/or fear</ul>
        <ul>As of 2020, 18% of US adults suffer from anxiety</ul>
        <ul>Diagnosed in an individual if the anxiety is causing significant impairment in their daily life and/or recurring panic attacks</ul>
        <ul>Anxiety may be caused by hereditary factors, thyroid issues, arrythmias, chemical balances, environmental factors and/or negative events during early childhood</ul>
        <ul>Treatments include benzodiazophenes which act as GABA agonists</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>The Gut-Brain Axis</b>
      <li>Many studies show that the gut microbiome has been the human's companion throughout evolutionary history. THere is also a high correlation between brain development and microbiota development</li>
    
      <li>The gut microbiome is constantly being updated and dynamic throughout our lives especially via diet</li>
      <li>It is present from the prenatal phase and proliferates throughout a person's life, but most prominent during adulthood. Maternal health greatly affects the microbiota of her offspring. It is shown that vaginal births expose an infant to diverse amount of healthy gut microbiota. Beginning from age 1 to 3, a baby would already have about the same amount of microbiome diversity as an adult</li>
      <li>A diverse microbiome is a healthy microbiome. Microbiota within children act as a growth support by synthesizing vitamins and improving the immune system (anti-inflammatory pathways)</li>
      
      <br><li>Studies show that probiotics have been shown to relieve symptoms shown in autistic or ADHD- diagnosed children</li>
      
      <br><li>Adolescents and young adults who are recent college students are exposed to a new diet, environment and social status. Many of them are vulnerable to mental health issues because they find it difficult to adjust to the new lifestyle. This is proven by taking samples of the gut microbiome of various adolescents; it is found that even the gut microbiome shows a transition from a childlike biome to an adultlike biome by incorporating new species of microbiota. The most prominent microbiome transition occur prominent secondary sex characteristics ensue</li>
      
      <br><li>Research shows that taking antibiotics unnecessarily can partially eliminate our gut microbiome. This may lead to mental health issues</li>
      
      <br><li>The autonomic nervous system affects gut motility, permeability, epithelial fluid membrane, bile secretion, mucus production and so on</li>
        <ul>Microbiota communicate with the nervous system via neurotransmitters & neuroactive metabolites
          <li>They are able to produce serotonin (actually makes up the majority of it), GABA, 4-ethylphenylsulfate (induces anxiety)</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>Many daily activities can alter gut microbiota like emotions, exercise, diet, social interaction and possible medications</li>
        <ul>In terms of genetics & epigenetics, modifications in histones & microRNAs can change microbiome diversity</ul>
        <ul>Microbiota can come into contact with epithelial cells, peripheral neurons & immune cells</ul>
        <ul>In terms of diet, applying a Mediterranean diet has a different effect than when applying a "Western" diet (diet high in fats)
          <li>It is shown that a Mediterarranean diet may improve symptoms of depression</li>
          <li>This leads to the field of nutrional psychiatry</li>
          <li>Poor diet is now classified as a risk factor for depression</li>
          <li>Resveratrol (a polyphenol and antioxidant found in blueberries and grapes) may decrease depressive behaviours, lighten inflammatory effects & decreaase cortisol. More research is needed to prove correlations</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li>Studies in mice show that germ-free mice (mice lacking a gut microbiome) exhibit depressive behaviours</li>
      <li>Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) also express a decrease in fecal microbial richness and high cortisol levels</li>
      <li>Studies have shown that probiotics improve depressive and anxiety symptoms. One commercial prebiotic known as B-GOS has been shown to significantly improve anxiety levels in individuals with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Individuals with IBS have been found to show altered serotonin signaling between gut epithelial cells. In one study, individuals who had an intake  of Lacterobacillus plantarum DR7 (a probiotic and/or psychobiotic) showed alleviated anxiety and stress associated symptoms</li>
    </ul>
