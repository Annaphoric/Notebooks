    <h2>Lecture 1.14: Calcium Homeostasis</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Bone</b>
      <li class="blue">Also referred to as osseus tissue</li>
      <li>It is made up of primarily Ca<sup>2+</sup>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> (Calcium Phosphate)</li>
      <li>99% of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the body is found in bone</li>
      
      <br><li>There are 3 types of cells that make up osseus tissue: </li>
        <ul>Osteocytes</ul>
        <ul><b>Osteoblasts</b>
          <li>The cells that build bone</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Osteoclasts</b>
          <li>The cells that break down bone</li>
        </ul>
        
      <br><li>Extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is maintained at a homeostatic range by many hormones. Hormones that favour bone formation & increased bone mass include: </li>
        <ul>Insulin</ul><ul>Growth Hormone</ul><ul>IGF-1</ul><ul>Estrogen</ul><ul>Testosterone</ul><ul>Calcitonin</ul>
      <li>Hormones that favour bone resorption (breakdown) & decreased bone mass include: </li>
        <ul>Parathyroid Hormone</ul><ul>Cortisol</ul><ul>Thyroid Hormones (T<sub>3</sub>/T<sub>4</sub>)</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Parathyroid Hormone</b>
      <li>Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) is released when [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>blood</sub> is low. This low level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the stimulus for the 4 parathyroid glands to release PTH</li>
      
      <br><li>There are 4 main PTH responses: </li>
        <ul>An increase in osteoclast activity. Osteoclasts break down bone to liberate Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions  into the blood plasma</ul>
        <ul>An increase in absorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in the intestines. In other words, more Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are extracted from food particles as they travel down the small intestines. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is diffused from the intestinal walls and into blood vessels. This function is agonistic to the function of Vitamin D which is discussed next</ul>
        <ul>An increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> reabsorption in the kidneys. This allows less Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to be excreted as urine and more of it to enter the bloodstream from nephrotic tubules</ul>
        <ul>A decrease in the reabsorption of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> in the kidneys, excreting more PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions. This, in turn, increases the amount of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions for extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] homeostasis</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Vitamin D</b>
      <li>Also classified as a hormone</li>
      <li>Can be obtained via diet as D<sub>2</sub> or D<sub>3</sub> or via sunlight by converting 7-dehydrocholesterol into D<sub>3</sub> in skin</li>
      <li>Once vitamin D is deposited in the liver, it is hydroxylated once into 25-Hydroxy-D<sub>3</sub> in the liver. Then, it travels to the kidneys to become hydroxylated once again into 1,25-Dihydroxy-D<sub>3</sub> (with the help of 1-Hydroxylase, activated by PTH), which is the active form of vitamin D. The activated vit-D stimulates the transcription/translation of more Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels located on intestinal epithelial cells. This causes the absorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> & PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions into the blood</li>
      
      <br><li>Since vit-D is a fat-soluble vitamin, it can be stored in adipose tissue</li>
      
      <br><li>Research has shown that vit-D also strengthens innate immunity by promoting barrier integrity & microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract</li>
      
      <br><li>Vitamin D deficiency causes the release of PTH as an attempt to increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>blood</sub></li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Calcitonin</b>
      <li class="blue">A peptide hormone secreted by parafollicular cells in the thyroid gland</li>
      <li>A high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>blood</sub> is the stimulus for the secretion of calcitonin, which is uncommon. Although, this is also a stimulus for osteoblast activity, which deposits the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in blood into osseus tissue. So, it is said that the role of calcitonin is to stimulate osteoblast activity</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Osteoporosis</b>
      <li>The physiological condition that is caused by excess bone resorption (breakdown) and insufficient bone formation</li>
      <li>This causes bone to be fragile and more prone to fractures</li>
      <li>Likelihood of this condition increases with age, but it is most likely due to physical inactivity. Although this condition can occur with anyone, it is more likely to occur in women since they originally produce greater amounts of estrogen which protects bone but is lost as they age</li>
    </ul>
