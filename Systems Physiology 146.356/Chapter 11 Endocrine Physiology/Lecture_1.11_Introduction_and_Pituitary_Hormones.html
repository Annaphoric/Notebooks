    <h2>Lecture 1.11: Endocrine Overview & Pituitary Hormones</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Introduction</b>
      <li class="blue">The <b>endocrine system</b> consists of ductless glands or cells that secrete <b>hormones</b> into the bloodstream, unlike the <b>exocrine system</b> which is composed of glands with ducts that secrete paracrines into the nearby lumen (extracellular space) for excretion</li>
      <li>Hormones/endocrines are chemical messengers that enter the blood stream to reach a target cell</li>
        <ul>The target cells have receptors which bind to the hormone, causing an intracellular effect</ul>
        <ul>Their purpose is to integrate physiological processes and maintain homeostasis</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Hormone Classification</b>
      <li>Hormones are classified by their structure as shown in the following table: </li>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Class</th><th>Structure/Synthesis</th><th>Examples</th><th>Receptor Location</th><th>Solubility/Transportation</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Amines</th><td>Derived from tyrosine</td><td>Thyroid hormones, epinephrine + norepinephrine, dopamine</td><td>On plasma membrane (exception is thyroid hormone (TH) which is intracellular)</td><td>Water-soluble, hydrophilic (exception is TH which is fat-soluble & hydrophobic); Dissolved in blood plasma (exception is TH which requires a binding protein to travel in blood)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Peptides/Proteins</th><td>Size ranges greatly; Synthesized on ribosomes</td><td>Insulin, glucagon, anterior pituitary hormones, oxytocin, anti-diuretic hormone</td><td>On plasma membrane</td><td>Water-soluble, hydrophilic; Dissolved in blood plasma</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Sterols</th><td>Derived from cholesterol; Hydrophobic</td><td>Gonadotropins (like estrogens & androgens), adrenocorticotropins (like cortisol & aldosterone)</td><td>Intracellular</td><td>Fat-soluble, hydrophobic</td>
        </tr>  
      </table>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Hormone Secretion/Excretion</b>
      <li class="blue">Concentration of hormones in blood plasma depends on the secretion rate & removal rate (whether it be via excretion or metabolism)</li>
        <ul>This is done mainly by the liver & kidney</ul>
        <ul>Complications arise if these rates are imbalanced</ul>
      <li>Endocrine cells secrete hormones that travel to the bloodstream. These hormones either bind to their target cells to initiates a cellular response or are excreted in the urine or feces. Metabolism of the hormone can also occur to activate it prior to binding to a target cell or inactivate it prior to being excreted</li>
      <li>Hormone secretion rate can be regulated by ions, nutrients, neurotransmitters or other hormones (tropins)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Pituitary Gland & Hormones</b>
      <li>The pituitary gland is connected to the hypothalamus via the infundibulum</li>
        <ul><b>Posterior pituitary gland</b>
          <li>Connected directly to the hypothalamus via neurons</li>
          <li>Secretes 2 peptides hormones: oxytocin & vasopressin/anti-diuretic hormone (ADH)</li>
          <li>These hormones are synthesized in the hypothalamus</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Anterior pituitary gland</b>
          <li>Connected directly to the blood stream via a <b>portal system</b> (various blood vessels)</li>
          <li>Secretes 6 peptide hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH), growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), & prolactin</li>
          <li>These hormones are synthesized within this section of the gland, but are stimulated by hypothalamic hormones (hormones that are produced in the hypothalamus)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Posterior Pituitary Hormones</b>
      <li><b>Oxytocin (heart emoji)</b></li>
        <ul>Promotes milk ejection during lactation</ul>
        <ul>Promotes labour contraction mainly in the uterus</ul>
        <ul>Stimulates pair bonding, maternal love with child, and in general, love!</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Antidiuretic-hormone (ADH)</b></li>
        <ul>Promotes water retention</ul>
        <ul>Promotes smooth muscle constriction</ul>
        <ul>Decreases blood pressure</ul>
    </ul>

    <ul class="topic"><b>Anterior Pituitary Hormones</b>
      <li><b>Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) & luteinising hormone (LH)</b></li>
        <ul>Play an important factor in the reproductive system whether male or female</ul>
        <ul>Stimulate gonads to initiate germ cell development (specifically FSH) & secrete other hormones (specifically LH)</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Growth hormone (GH)</b></li>
        <ul>Promotes overall bodily growth (primarily bones & muscles)</ul>
        <ul>Secretes IGF-1</ul>
        <ul>Regulates general metabolism in many organs</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)</b></li>
        <ul>Stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) & triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>)</ul>
    
      <br><li><b>Prolactin</b></li>
        <ul>Stimulates milk production & breast development</ul>
    
      <br><li><b>Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)</b></li>
        <ul>Stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol</ul>
    </ul>
