    <h2>Lecture 1.13: Growth Hormone and Adrenal Hormones</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Growth Hormone</b>
      <li class="blue">Growth hormone (GH) is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. Its secretion is regulated by the hypotalamic hormone Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH) and Somatostatin</li>
        <ul class="red">GHRH up-regulates the release of GH; Somatostatin down-regulates the release of GH</ul>
      
      <br><li>Effects of GH</li>
        <ul>Stimulates epiphyseal plate hyperplastic growth located within osseus tissue (bone)</ul>
        <ul>Promotes the release of Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) in the liver
          <li>This generally promotes mitotic cell divisions, specifically cyclins</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Increases amino acid uptake & ribosome production, inducing protein synthesis (especially in muscle)</ul>
        <ul>Promotes triglyceride breakdown and circulation of these energy stores</ul>
        <ul>Promotes gluconeogenesis in the liver ("anti-insulin effects")</ul>
        
      <br><li>Regulation of GH</li>
        <ul>GH's stimulating hormones GHRH & Somatostatin are affected by circadian rhythms
          <li>Most of these hormones are released during sleep</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Sex hormones, insulin & TH also play a role in affecting the release of GH
          <li>Most of these are released during adolescence & puberty</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Growth Hormone Related Disorders/Treatments</b>
      <li class="blue">An indication of a GH-related disorder is abnormal levels GH and/or IGF-1</li>
      <li>GH-Insensitivity Syndrome is a condition where GH receptors fail to respond to circulating GH even though it is still being released</li>
      <li>Acromegaly is a condition where excess amount of GH is released during adulthood (most likely due to an anterior pituitary tumor). This leads to a sharp increase in bone size</li>
      
      <br><li>GH-Replacement Therapy is commonly prescribed to children who have a documented GH deficiency</li>
        <ul>This consists of taking supplementary GH-pills</ul>
        <ul>Long term risks for taking external GH is not yet well understood, but should still be taken with care</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Cortisol</b>
      <li>An adrenal hormone; also known as the stress hormone</li>
      <li>Secreted mainly by cells located in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex (medial part)</li>
      <li>Small amounts are secreted in the zona reticularis (deepest part of the adrenal cortex)</li>
      <li>It is stimulated by Adrenal Corticotropic hormone (ACTH) which is released from the anterior pituitary gland</li>
      <li>Promotes blood pressure homeostasis via permissive effects of epinephrine & norepinephrine</li>
        <ul>Specifically, blood pressure is increased by constricting blood vessels</ul>
      <li>Regulates enzyme production for overall metabolism, especially metabolism that occurs in the liver</li>
      <li>Maintains glucose at a homeostatic level</li>
        
      <br><li>Has anti-inflammatory properties</li>
        <ul>It slows down the immune system by decreasing the production of immune-related cytokines like prostaglandins and capillary permeability to injured tissue</ul>
          <ul>It also suppresses the growth of WBCs</ul>
        <ul>It can be administered as a shot (cortisone shot) to relieve heavy inflammation usually caused  by joint injuries that occur in an athletic event</ul>
      
      <br><li>Moderate levels of cortisol are required for these healthy bodily functions</li>
        <ul>Frequent high levels can have negative effects on overall health
          <li>This includes excess protein & fat degradation, gluconeogenesis</li>
          <li>It can also cause menstrual cycle delays or decrease testosterone levels</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Cortisol-related Disorders/Treatments</b>
      <li>Adrenal Insufficiency</li>
        <ul>Also referred to as Addison's Disease</ul>
        <ul>A disorder that causes low [cortisol]<sub>plasma</sub> & high [ACTH]<sub>plasma</sub>
          <li>Usually due to a malfunctioning adrenal gland or a disease that kills adrenal cells (like tuberculosis)</li>
          <li>This can also arise from an autoimmune disorder of the adrenal gland</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Symptoms include weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, hypotension</ul>
        <ul>Treatments include orally taking synthetic adrenal hormones</ul>
      
      <br><li>Adrenal Excess</li>
        <ul>Also referred to as Cushing's Syndrome</ul>
        <ul>A disorder that causes high [cortisol] & low [ACTH] in blood plasma, leading to an increase in catabolism/breakdown of bone & muscle
          <li>Usually due to an adrenal tumor</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Symptoms include increased appetite, weight gain, increased blood sugar</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Aldosterone</b>
      <li>An adrenal hormone secreted by cells in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex (most superficial part)</li>
      <li>Acts as an anti-diuretic hormone by increasing [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>blood</sub> via water retention in the kidneys</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Epinephrine & Norepinephrine</b>
      <li>The main sympathetic hormones that induce a "fight or flight" response</li>
      <li>Secreted by cells located in the adrenal medulla</li>
      <li>Functions include: </li>
        <ul>Promotes glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen into its glucose subunits)</ul>
        <ul>Promotes lipid breakdown</ul>
        <ul>Increases blood pressure, heart rate & cardiac function</ul>
        <ul>Increases blood flow to the heart & muscles</ul>
        <ul>Decreases blood flow to the digestive & visceral (adipotic) organs</ul>
        <ul>Promotes respiration by dilating airways</ul>
      
      <br><li>There are 2 types of adrenergic receptors: </li>
        <ul><b>α-adrenergic receptors</b>
          <li>Promotes vasoconstriction</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>β-adrenergic receptors</b>
          <li>Promotes vasodilation</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Both are metabotropic receptors</ul>
    </ul>
