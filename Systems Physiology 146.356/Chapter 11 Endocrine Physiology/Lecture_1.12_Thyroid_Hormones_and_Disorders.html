    <h2>Lecture 1.12: Thyroid Hormones & Disorders</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Thyroid Hormones</b>
      <li>Released by the thyroid gland located anterior to the trachea within the neck</li>
      <li>Refers to the 2 thyroid hormones: </li>
        <ul><b>Triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>)</b>
          <li>Considered to be the primary thyroid hormone</li>
          <li>Has 3 iodine atoms attached to it</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>)</b>
          <li class="red">Usually converted to T<sub>3</sub> in target tissues</li>
          <li>Has 4 iodine atoms attached to it</li>
          <li>Prescribed in the cases of thyroid disorders</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Both thyroid hormones consist of 2 tyrosines; one tyrosine is iodated twice (known as DIT or diiodotyrosine) and the 2<sup>nd</sup> one attached to it can be either monoiodated (known as MIT or monoiodotyrosine) or diiodated (DIT)</li>
      <li>The hypothalamus receives a signal to release <b>thyroid-releasing hormone</b> (TRH) which travels through hypothalamo-hyopheseal portal vessels to reach the anterior pituitary gland. TRH stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) which travels through blood plasma until it reaches the thyroid gland. T<sub>3</sub> & T<sub>4</sub> are both produced as a result and they travel toward target cells via blood plasma. Target cells can now respond to T<sub>3</sub> and store or convert T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub> when needed. TSH & T<sub>3</sub>/T<sub>4</sub> induce a negative feedback loop with their previous precursor hormones</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Thyroid Hormone Mechanism of Action</b>
      <li>Thyroid hormone receptors are located in the nuclei of most cells in the body</li>
      <li>T<sub>3</sub> has various effects on the body, including: </li>
        <ul>Stimulating the transcription + translation of metabolites. This affects basal metabolic rate (BMR; metabolism) by increasing carbohydrate absorption in the small intestine and fatty acid release from adipocytes. These fuel substrates are used to make ATP and produce heat via cellular respiration.</ul>
        <ul>Acting <b>permissively</b> (agonistically) on adrenomedullic (from the adrenal medulla) hormones which are epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine. Specifically, T<sub>3</sub> acts as an epinephrine agonist by up-regulating and increasing the amount of <b>Î²-adrenergic receptors</b> (receptors that bind to epinephrine & norepinephrine). This stimulates the sympathetic nervous system by increasing heart rate & blood pressure and induce the fight or flight response</ul>
        <ul>Stimluating the production of growth hormone, inducing normal bodily growth (physically & neurally)</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Thyroid Disorders</b>
      <li><b>Hypothyroidism</b></li>
        <ul>Arises due to a low [TH], resulting in a high [TRH] & [TSH]</ul>
        <ul>Commonly caused by Hashimoto's Disease (a type of autoimmune disorder; autoimmune thryoiditis)</ul>
        <ul>Symptoms include: cold intolerance, weight gain (due to a decrease in calorigenic reactions or general metabolism), fatigue and/or depression. In extreme cases, a goiter (extreme swelling of the thyroid) can develop</ul>
        <ul>Treatments include: taking synthetic T<sub>4</sub> (thyroxine) pills (correct dosage is chosen carefully)</ul>
        
      <br><li><b>Hyperthyroidism</b></li>
        <ul>Arises due to a high [TH], resulting in a low [TRH] & [TSH]</ul>
        <ul>Commonly caused by Grave's Disease (a type of autoimmune disorder). Antibodies that bind to TSH receptors are produced, inducing overstimulation of the thyroid gland and causing excessive growth</ul>
        <ul>Symptoms include: heat intolerance (heat oversensitivity), weight loss, increased appetite, increased sympathetic drive (sympathetic NS), tremors and/or fatigue. In extreme cases, a goiter can develop</ul>
        <ul>Treatments include: taking anti-thyroid drugs (like Methamazil; drugs that lower TH synthesis), taking that decrease heart rate, thyroidectomy (the removal of the thyroid gland; forcing hypothyroidism & hypoparathyroidism) </ul>
      
      <br><li>Supposedly, there is no link between stress & thyroid issues, but they clinically present themselves together</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Post-partum Thyroiditis</b>
      <li>Occurs within 5%-10% of women</li>
      <li>Possibly an autoimmune disorder where anti-thyroid antibodies attack the thyroid gland</li>
      <li>Initially, hyperthyrodic symptoms may arise like weight loss. After about 9 months after delivery, delayed hypothyrodic symptoms may arise like fatigue. Symptoms conclude after about a year after delivery; levels of TRH, TSH, & T<sub>3</sub>/T<sub>4</sub> should return back to a normal range</li>
    </ul>
