  <ul class="topic"> 
   <b>Glutamate's Effect on Excitation</b> 
   <li class="blue">Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter commonly used in sensory transduction</li> 
   <li>Like other neurotransmitters, it will cause a different response depending on the type of receptor</li> 
   <ul>
     Glutamate binds to post-synaptic bipolar cells after being released from rods & cones. Afterwards, bipolar cells send signals to ganglion cells then to the optic nerve, providing vision 
   </ul> 
   <br>
   <li class="red">When rods & cones are slightly depolarised (-35mV), glutamate is released to a greater extent than when rods, specifically, are hyperpolarised (-70mV) </li> 
   <li class="red">Photoreceptor cells & bipolar cells only induce local potentials; ganglion cells only induce action potentials</li> 
  </ul>
  
  <ul class="topic">
   <b>Color Vision/Blindness</b> 
   <li>There are 3 types of cones: </li> 
   <ul>
    <span class="blue">Blue cones</span> 
    <li>Absorb the most light at 420nm</li> 
   </ul> 
   <ul>
    <span class="green">Green cones</span> 
    <li>Absorb the most light at 531nm</li> 
   </ul> 
   <ul>
    <span class="red">Red cones</span> 
    <li>Absorb the most light at 558nm</li> 
   </ul> 
   <br>
   <li>Colour blindness occurs when one or more of these cones are missing</li> 
   <ul>
    This condition is a sex-linked disorder and most commonly affects red and/or green cones
   </ul> 
  </ul> 
  
  <ul class="topic">
   <b>Audition</b> 
   <li>Sound occurs when sound waves hit the <span class="green">tympanic membrane</span> (eardrum), causing the movement of the Malleus, Incus and Stapes bones within the middle ear cavity. This then causes the fluid in the cochlea to move and this movement is detected by the vestibulocochlear nerve (Cranial Nerve 8)</li> 
   <li>Within the cochlea, the Organ of Corti works with the cochlear duct containing <b>endolymph</b></li> 
   <ul>
    Endolymph is an extracellular fluid that contains high K
    <sup>+</sup> levels and low Na
    <sup>+</sup> levels (one of the only interstitial fluids containing these set of ion concentrations)
   </ul> 
   <li><b>The inner hair cells</b>, which are part of the Organ of Corti, play an important role in audition</li> 
   <br>
   <li><b>Transduction of Sound</b></li> 
   <ul>
    When there is no sound present, tip links located on <span class="green">stereocilia</span> of inner hair cells are loose, keeping mechanically gated K
    <sup>+</sup> leak channels closed
   </ul> 
   <ul>
    When a sound wave is detected and makes contact with stereocilia, the tip links are forced to stretch, opening the K
    <sup>+</sup> channels and allowing K
    <sup>+</sup> ions to flow inside the cell. The membrane potential slightly depolarises enough to open voltage gated Ca
    <sup>+</sup> channels and allow neurotransmitters to be released. These neurotransmitters bind to an afferent neuron via synapse, detecting this transduction as sound
   </ul> 
  </ul>
  
  <ul class="topic"><b>Gustation/Taste</b>
    <li class="blue">A specific type of taste is recognised by <b>taste cells</b> within the taste buds located underneath lingual papillae (buds on the tongue)</li>
      <ul>An afferent neuron is stimulated by the taste cells via synapse</ul>
    <li>There are 5 general types of taste: </li>
      <ul><b>Salty</b>
        <li>Induced when external Na<sup>+</sup> ions bind to an ionotropic recepter of a taste cell</li>
      </ul>
      <ul><b>Sour</b>
        <li>Induced when external H<sup>+</sup> ions bind to an ionotropic recepter of a taste cell</li>
      </ul>
      <ul><b>Sweet</b>
        <li>Induced when external sweet tastants like glucose, sugar, aspartame or sucralose bind to a metabotropic receptor of a taste cell</li>
      </ul>
      <ul><b>Bitter</b>
        <li>Induced when external bitter tastants bind to a metabotropic recepter of a taste cell</li>
      </ul>
      <ul><b>Umami/Savoury</b>
        <li>Induced when external glutamate (like MSG or monosodium glutamate) binds to a ionotropic/metabotropic recepter of a taste cell</li>
      </ul>
    <li>There is also another recently discovered taste receptor family that is associated with high fat content</li>
  </ul>
  
  <ul class="topic"><b>Olfaction/Smell</b>
    <li class="blue">Smell is recognised directly by afferent neurons (olfactory nerves)</li>
    <li>Every odorant has their own metabotropic receptor (known as G<sub>olf</sub> receptors or G-protein olfactory receptors) associated with it</li>
      <ul>Different species of animals have more or less receptors than others</ul>
    <li class="red">It is the only sense that does not synapse in the thalamus before reaching the cerebral cortex. Instead, it synapses with the limbic system before reaching the cerebral cortex</li>
      <ul>The limbic system is responsible for processing emotions/feelings</ul>
  </ul>
