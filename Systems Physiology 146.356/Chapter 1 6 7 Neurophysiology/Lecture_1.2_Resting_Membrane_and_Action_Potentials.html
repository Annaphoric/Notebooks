    <h2>Lecture 1.2: Resting, Local & Action Potentials</h2>
  
    <ul class="topic"><b>Distribution of Ions</b>
      <li>Normally, [Na<sup>+</sup>] is higher outside the cells than inside
      while the [K<sup>+</sup>] is higher inside the cell</li>
      <li class="red">Nerve cells are most permeable to K<sup>+</sup></li>
        
      <br><li>Ions move across the membrane through <b>5</b> main channels/transporters: </li>
        <ul><span>Sodium/Potassium Pump</span>
          <li>Pumps 2 K<sup>+</sup> ions into the cell for every 3 Na<sup>+</sup> ions pumped out</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Sodium leak channels</ul>
        <ul>Potassium leak channels</ul>
        <ul>Sodium voltage-gated channels</ul>
        <ul>Potassium voltage-gated channels</ul>
        <ul>The last 4 channels are found in around a 1:20:5:5 ratio in abundance on a neuron 
        (with K<sup>+</sup> channels being the most abundant; 
        thus the membrane is most permeable to K<sup>+</sup>)
        </ul>
          
      <br><li>Leak channels are always open, especially K<sup>+</sup> channels,
      thereby giving the inside of the cells a net negative charge <span class="red">in the membrane</span></li>
        <ul>The Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump deposits K<sup>+</sup> ions back into the cell
        but isn't as abundant as the K<sup>+</sup> leak channels so the net negativity still remains</ul>
      <li class="red"><b>Depolarisation</b> is the process of increasing positivity in the membrane</li>
      <li class="red"><b>Repolarisation</b> is the process of increasing negativity in the membrane</li>
      <li>The greater the difference in concentrations, the greater the driving force of diffusion</li><br>
        
      <li><b>Hyperkalemia</b></li>
        <ul><span class="blue">A condition where the [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>blood</sub>
        is consistently higher than normal</span>
          <li>This causes a neuron to become <i>more excitable/depolarisable</i> due to an elevated resting membrane potential</li>
            <ul>Tremors, twitches, and irregular heartbeats can occur as a result</ul>
        </ul>
      
      <li><b>Hypernatremia</b></li>
      <ul><span class="blue">A condition where the [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>blood</sub> is consistently higher than normal</span>
        <li>This causes an increase in a neuron action potential's spike height </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Voltage values of Membrane Potentials in most neurons</b>
      <li>Resting Potential</li>
        <ul class="red">Approximately -70mV</ul>
      <li>Threshold Potential</li>
        <ul class="red">Approximately -55mV</ul>
      <li>Peak Potential</li>
        <ul class="red">Approximately +30mV</ul>
    </ul>
  
    <ul class="topic"><b>2 Types of Potentials Fired by Neurons</b>
      <li class="bold">Action Potential</li>
        <ul class="blue">The event of propagating an electrical signal down an axon
         to communicate to other cells (whether it be other neurons or muscle cells)</ul>
        <ul>Always causes depolarisation</ul>
        <ul>Stimulated by the opening of voltage-gated channels</ul>
        <ul>Its magnitude is independent of the strength of the stimulus,
        instead it is dependent on the frequency of the stimulus (which is high)</ul>
        <ul><span class="red">Does <b>not</b> decrement with distance traveled along the axon</span>
          <li>This is due to the presence of myelin sheaths & nodes of Ranvier</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>They cannot sum up due to the implementation of a refractory period</ul>
          
      <br><li class="bold">Local/Graded/Receptor/Synaptic Potential</li>
        <ul class="blue">The event of stimulating an excitatory or inhibitory reponse
         without causing an action potential</ul>
        <ul>Can cause either depolarisation or hyperpolarisation</ul>
        <ul>Stimulated by ligands/messengers binding to a ligand-gated channel</ul>
        <ul>Its magnitude is dependent on the strength (amplitude) of the stimulus</ul>
        <ul class="red">Decrements with distance traveled along the axon</ul>
        <ul>They can sum up when stimulated at close enough times to each other</ul>
    </ul>
