    <h2>Lecture 1.3: Synapses</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Synaptic Transmissions</b>
      <li class="blue">A <b>synapse</b> is the communication made within a cell-to-cell junction</li>
      <li>There are 2 types of synapses:</li>
        <ul><b>Electrical</b>
          <li>Current flows through a <span class="red">gap junction</span> connected between 2 cells</li>
          <li>Not as numerous as chemical synapses, except in cardiac muscle cells</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul><b>Chemical</b>
          <li>Neurotransmitters flow through a <span class="red">synaptic cleft</span> from one cell to another</li>
          <li>Numerous when involving neurons</li>
        </ul>
        
      <br><li class="green">A cellular response that opens K<sup>+</sup> channels causes an inhibitory (hyperpolarisable) response</li>
      <li class="green">A cellular response that opens Na<sup>+</sup> channels causes an excitatory (depolarisable) response</li>
      
      <br><li>There are 2 types of post-synaptic (ligand-gated) receptors: </li>
        <ul><b>Ionotropic</b>
          <li class="blue">A receptor that also acts as a to allow the influx of ions</li>
          <li class="red">Cellular responses are quick and short-lived</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Metabotropic</b>
          <li class="blue">A receptor that causes a signaling cascade that includes a 2° messenger</li>
          <li class="red">Cellular responses are slow and long-lasting</li>
          <li>Also known as GTP-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ol class="red"><b class="black">Mechanism of Chemical Synapses</b>
      <li>An action potential propagates from the body of a pre-synaptic neuron to its axon terminals</li>
      <li>Ca<sup>+</sup> ions rush into the axon terminal of the pre-synaptic neuron through <span>voltage-gated Ca<sup>+</sup> channels</span></li>
      <li>Ca<sup>+</sup> ions help fuse the vesicles within the axon terminal onto the pre-synaptic membrane, releasing their neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft</li>
      <li>These neurotransmitter bind to post-synaptic dendritic receptors</li>
      <li>The post-synaptic neuron undergoes a cellular response which can be either excitatory/depolarisable or inhibitory/hyperpolarisable</li>
      <li>Neurotransmitters are removed and recycled from the synaptic cleft</li>
    </ol>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>How Drugs Affect Chemical Synapses</b>
      <li>There are many ways drugs can affect synapse depending on their stucture/chemistry. Some examples include: </li>
        <ul>Increasing the leakage of neurotransmitters from vesicles to the pre-synaptic cytoplasm, causing them to be degraded by enzymes</ul>
        <ul>Inhibiting or stimulating neurotransmitter release, synthesis, metabolism or reuptake</ul>
        <ul>Binding to a post-synaptic recepter to block <span class="red">(antagonist behaviour)</span> or mimic <span class="red">(agonistic behaviour)</span> the neurotransmitter itself</ul>
        <ul>Causing the inhibition or stimulation of 2° messengers</ul>
      
      <br><li class="bold">Mechanism of Cocaine</li>
        <ul class="blue">Blocks the reuptake transporter protein that alows dopamine to be recycled from the synaptic cleft into the pre-synaptic neuron
          <li class="red">This allows dopamine to remain within the synaptic cleft, bind to the post-synaptic neuron more frequently, and result in more frequent excitatory responses</li>
          <li class="black">As a result, new receptors are formed on the post-synaptic membrane, causing the feeling of withdrawal and dependency</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li class="bold">Mechanism of Antidepressants</li>
        <ul class="blue">Similar to cocaine, these drugs block a reuptake transporter protein. The difference is that serotonin is the target neurotransmitter instead of dopamine</ul>
        <ul>Common antidepressants include: 
          <li>Zoloft</li><li>Prozac</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>These drugs are known as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</ul>
      
      <br><li class="bold">Mechanism of Anti-Anxiety Medications</li>
        <ul class="blue">Promotes the binding of GABA onto a post-synaptic receptor or mimics its mechanism</ul>
        <ul class="red">Since GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter and anti-anxiety medications are GABA-agonists, the post-synaptic neuron will be less likely to excite
          <li class="green">This allows a person to feel more calm more frequently</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>GABA<sub>A</sub> is an ionotopic receptor that allows that influx of Cl<sup>-</sup> ions</ul>
        <ul>Examples of anti-anxiety medications include: 
          <li>Benzodiazepines like Valium & Xanax</li>
        </ul>
      
      <br><li class="bold">Mechanism of Opioids</li>
        <ul class="blue">Inhibits a modulatory interneuron's (neuroglial cell) inhibitory effect of a pre-synaptic neuron containing dopamine within its vesicles
          <li class="black">This allows the pre-synaptic neuron to become more excitable and more likely to release its dopamine into the synaptic cleft, allowing more of its binding to the post-synaptic receptor</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
