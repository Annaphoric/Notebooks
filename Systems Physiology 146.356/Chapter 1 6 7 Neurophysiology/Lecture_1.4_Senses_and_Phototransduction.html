    <h2>Lecture 1.4: Senses and Phototransduction</h2>
  
    <ul class="topic"><b>Sensory Receptors</b>
      <li class="blue">These receptors convert an external stimulus into receptor/local potentials (LPs) and eventually into an action potentials (APs)</li>
      <li>They are located on the peripheral ends of an <b>afferent neuron</b></li>
        <ul>A neuron that sends a signal from the axon terminal to the nucleus</ul>
      <li>There are 2 types: </li>
        <ul><b>Receptor-cell mediated</b>
          <li class="blue">Includes a receptor cell between the external stimulus & afferent neuron</li>
            <ul>The receptor cell sends LPs to its afferent neuron which can lead to an AP </ul>
          <li class="red">Occurs in vision, taste, & auditory stimuli</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>Non-receptor-cell mediated</b>
          <li class="blue">Does not include a receptor cell between the external stimulus & afferent neuron</li>
          <li class="red">Occurs in olfactory stimuli</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  
    <ul class="topic"><b>Vision</b>
      <li>There are 5 types of cells located on the <b>retina</b> (back of the eye)</li>
        <ul><b>Photoreceptor cells</b>
          <li class="blue">Cells that receive light stimuli and send signals to bipolar cells</li>
          <li>Includes rods & cones</li>
          <li class="red">Mainly permeable to Na<sup>+</sup> & Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, increasing their resting membrane potential (RMP) to around -35mV</li>
          <li>Most posterior</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Horizontal cells</ul>
        <ul>Bipolar cells</ul>
        <ul>Amacrine cells</ul>
        <ul><b>Ganglion cells</b>
          <li class="blue">Cells that are connected to and interact with the <b>optic nerve</b> (their axon)</li>
          <li>They fire an AP that travels toward the optic nerve</li>
          <li>Most anterior</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Organisation of Cells within the Retina</b>
      <li>Photoreceptors are depolarised (having a potential difference of around -35mV) at rest</li>
      <li>Molecules/peptides that play a role in phototransduction include: </li>
        <ul><b>Rhodopsin</b>
          <li class="blue">A photopigment made up of opsin & retinal (light-sensitive molecule) located on rods & cones</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Transducin</ul>
        <ul>Guanylyl Cyclase</ul>
        <ul>Cyclic GMP</ul>
        <ul>Cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase</ul>
        <ul>Non-selective Cation Channels</ul>
    </ul>
      
    <ul class="topic"><b>Transduction</b>
      <br><ol><span class="red">In the dark: </span>
        <li><b>Guanylyl cyclase</b> converts GTP to cGMP</li>
        <li><b>cGMP</b> acts as a ligand to continuously bind to <b>non-selective cation channels</b>, keeping them open. This allows Na<sup>+</sup> & Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to diffuse into the cell</li>
        <li>Photoreceptors become slightly depolarised (having a RMP of around -35mV)</li>
      </ol>
      
      <br><ol><span class="red">In the light: </span>
        <li>Light hits rhodopsin, causing the photo-rearrangement of cis-retinal into trans-retinal. This changes the overall structure of rhodopsin</li>
        <li>Opsin activates <b>transducin</b></li>
        <li>Transducin promotes the synthesis of <b>cGMP phosphodiesterase</b>. This enzyme cleaves a P<sub>i</sub> group from cGMP, deactivating it</li>
        <li>Non-selective cation channels close due to the decrease of intracellular cGMP </li>
        <li>Photoreceptors become more hyperpolarised (having a RMP of around -70mV)</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
