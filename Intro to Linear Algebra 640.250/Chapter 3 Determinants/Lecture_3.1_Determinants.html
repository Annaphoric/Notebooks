    <h2>Lecture 3.1: Determinants</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Determinants</b>
      <li><b>Determinants</b> (cross products) are used to solve for the area of a parallelogram made by enclosing 2 vectors with each other. The result of determinants is always a scalar. The area is found by combining those 2 vectors into a matrix, with size 2 ⨯ 2, and finding the determinant of the resulting matrix.</li>
        <ul>The resulting matrix must be a square matrix; if not, then the determinant is not valid</ul>
        
      <li>Given the 2 vectors <b>u</b> & <b>v</b>, the determinant of matrix A is the product of the entries in the diagonal subtracted by the product of the entries in the off-diagonal: </li>
        <ul class="red">determinant(A) = |product(diagonal) - product(off-diagonal)|</ul>
        <ul class="red">determinant(A) = |<b>u</b> ⨯ <b>v</b>|</ul>
      
      <br><li>Changing the order of the vectors in the matrix gives the opposite of the determinant; hence why the absolute value is needed for the true area</li>
      
      <br><li>If one vector is within the span of the other (lie on the same axis; dependent), the determinant of the vectors is always zero</li>
      
      <br><li>Enclosing together 3 vectors in 3D gives the shape of a parallelopiped. The volume of this shape is the determinant of the matrix of the 3 vectors. In this case, the dot product of 2 vectors and the cross product of the resulting vector with the other vector (triple scalar product) gives the volume of the parallelopiped</li>
        <ul>If all 3 vectors are dependent to each other, the determinant is zero</ul>
      
      <br><li><b>Co-factor Expansion</b> is the method used to compute the determinant of a matrix of size n ⨯ n</li>
        <ul>The size of the matrix is reduced by 1 column & row (n - 1) until it is size 2 ⨯ 2:
          <li>while(size(A) != (2 ⨯ 2)): rows(A) -= 1; columns(A) -= 1;</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Any row & column can be used for the expansion method, but a column & row with more zeros is preferred to simplify arithmatic</ul>
        <ul>If a row is chosen, the 2 ⨯ 2 matrix that is not part of that row and column is isolated and the determinant of the matrix is calculated. The resulting determinant scalar is then multiplied by its <b>co-factor</b>. The co-factor is the product of the current entry and its corresponding <b>signature</b>, which is (-1)<sup>p + q</sup> where p = row of entry & q = column of entry. This is continued until there are no more entries left in the chosen row. The determinant of the original matrix is the sum of all 2 ⨯ 2 determinants multiplied by their corresponding signatures</ul>
      
      <br><li>If the determinant is zero, the vectors are dependent; if it is not zero, the vectors are independent</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 1: </b>
      <ol>Find the area S made by enclosing vector <b>u</b> = [[4] [1]] with vector <b>v</b> = [[2] [6]].
      
        <br><br><li>Combining the vectors to make matrix A: </li>
          <ul>A = [[4] [1]] & [[2] [6]]</ul>
          <ul>A = [[4 2] [1 6]]</ul>
        
        <br><li>Finding the determinant of A (which is equal to the area S): </li>
          <ul>determinant(A) = (4 * 6) - (2 * 1)</ul>
          <ul>determinant(A) = 24 - 2</ul>
          <ul class="green">determinant(A) = 22</ul>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 2: </b>
      <li>Find the determinant of matrix A = [[2 -1 3] [1 4 -2] [-1 0 1]]</li>
      
      <br><ul>Choosing the first row to traverse: 
        <li>determinant(A) = 2((4 * 1) - (-2 * 0))(-1)<sup>2</sup> + (-1)((1 * 1) - (-2 * -1))(-1)<sup>3</sup> + 3((1 * 0) - (4 * -1))(-1)<sup>4</sup></li>
        <li>determinant(A) = 2(4) + (1 - 2) + 3(4)</li>
        <li>determinant(A) = 8 - 1 + 12</li>
        <li class="green">determinant(A) = 19</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 3: </b>
      <li>Determine the determinant of matrix B = [[1 2 1 -1] [0 -1 0 1] [4 -3 2 -1] [0 3 0 -2]]</li>
      
        <br><ul>Choosing the second row: 
          <li>determinant(B) = 0 (-1) * determinant([[2 1 -1] [-3 2 -1] [3 0 -1]]) - (1) * determinant([[1 1 -1] [4 2 -1] [0 0 -2]]) + 0 (-1) * determinant([[1 2 -1] [4 -3 -1] [0 3 -2]]) + (1) * determinant([[1 2 1] [4 -3 2] [0 3 0]])</li>
          <li>determinant(B) = - (-2)(1)(2 - 4) + (3)(-1)(2 - 4)</li>
          <li>determinant(B) = -4 + 6</li>
          <li class="green">determinant(B) = 2</li>
