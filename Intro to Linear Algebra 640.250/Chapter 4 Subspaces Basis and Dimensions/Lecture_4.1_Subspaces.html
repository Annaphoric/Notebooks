    <h2>Lecture 4.1: Subspaces</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Subspaces</b>
      <li class="blue">A subspace is a region in space like a plane or bounded object</li>
      
      <br><li>In order for a set S of vectors <b>v</b> & <b>w</b> to lie within the span of a subspace E, the vectors and their sum (including linear combinations) must lie within the subspace regardless of a scalar multiple: </li>
        <ul class="red">if({<b>v</b>, <b>w</b>, a<b>v</b> + b<b>w</b>} in E): S is a subspace</ul>
        
        <ul>This works for k-vectors in R<sup>n</sup>. The vectors are known as generators for the subspace closed under addition (any vector added to a vector within the set of vectors would still have the same span) & scalar multiplication (any scalar multiplied to a vector would still have the same span)</ul>
        
      <br><li>A zero vector lies within every subspace</li>
      
      <br><li>When a coefficient matrix A is multiplied to a vector of variables and set equal to a zero vector (a homogenous system), the vector containing the variables forms a subspace known as a <b>nullspace</b>. Nullspace is also called the kernel</li>

    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 1: </b>
      <li>Given set W = {[[r - s + 3t] [2r - t] [-r + 3s + 2t] [-2r + s + t]]} for all real numbers in 4D, is this set a subspace?</li>
      
        <br><ul>If W is in the span of every vector it contains, then W is a subspace. Rewriting the set as a sum of vectors: 
          <li>[[r] [2r] [-r] [-2r]] + [[-s] [0] [3s] [s]] + [[3t] [-t] [2t] [t]]</li>
          <li>r [[1] [2] [-1] [-2]] + s [[-1] [0] [3] [1]] + t [[3] [-1] [2] [1]]</li>
          <li class="green">Since this set of vectors are all dependent to each other, W is a subspace generated by the 3 vectors</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 2: </b>
      <ol>Given system of equations S = {-3x + y + z + w = 0;  x - y + z = 0;  x + y - z + 2w = 0}, is this system a subspace?
      
        <br><br><li>Rewriting the system in a matrix form: </li>
          <ul>[[-3 1 1 1][1 -1 1 0] [1 1 -1 2]] [[x] [y] [z] [w]] = [[0] [0] [0]]</ul>
          <ul class="green">This system is a homogenous system since the coefficient matrix is set equal to a zero vector. The variables (or vector of variables) that satisfies the homogenous equations form a nullspace</ul>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 3: </b>
      <li>Given matrix A = [[1 -2 -1 0] [0 1 3 -2] [-2 3 -1 2]], is vector <b>v</b> = [[1] [1] [-1] [1]] in null(A) (or in the nullspace of A)?</li>
      
        <br><ul>vector <b>b</b> must be a solution (by plugging in the values of the components of the vector into the variables) for the homogenous system set by the matrix A as a coefficient matrix. The matrix can be written as a system of equations or multiplied to A as a coefficient matrix. Multiplying A with <b>v</b>: 
          <li>[[1 -2 -1 0] [0 1 3 -2] [-2 3 -1 2]] â‹… [[1] [1] [-1] [1]] == <b>0</b></li>
          <li>[[0] [-4] [5]] == [[0] [0] [0]] (false)</li>
          <li>Since this equation is false, vector <b>v</b> does not lie in the span of matrix A is therefore not a solution to the equation. This also means <b>v</b> is not in null(A)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 4: </b>
      <ol>Given matrix A = [[1 1 -1 4] [2 1 -3 5] [-2 0 4 -2]], what is the generating set (solutions) for null(A)?
      
        <br><br><li>Converting the coefficient matrix A to a Row Echelon Form: </li>
          <ul>[[1 1 -1 4] [2 1 -3 5] [-2 0 4 -2]]</ul>
          <ul>[[<b>1</b> 1 -1 4] [0 -1 -1 -3] [0 2 2 6]] (E2 = E2 - 2E1;  E3 = E3 + 2 E1)</ul>
          <ul>[[<b>1</b> 1 -1 4] [0 <b>-1</b> -1 -3] [0 0 0 0]] (E3 = E3 + 2E2)</ul>
        
        <br><li>Solving for the variables of the system of equations: </li>
          <ul>{x + y - z + 4w = 0;  -y - z - 3w = 0}</ul>
          <ul>x = z - y - 4w;  y = -(z + 3w)</ul>
          <ul>x = z + (z + 3w) - 4w</ul>
          <ul>x = 2z - w;  y = -(z + 3w);  z = z;  w = w</ul>
          
          <br><ul class="green">Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is [[2z - w] [-z - 3w] [z] [w]] or (z [[2] [-1] [1] [0]] + w [[-1] [-3] [0] [1]]). Since there are 2 vectors within the set of solutions for null(A), the solution is a 2D plane (subspace/nullspace) in 4D space</ul>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 5: </b>
      <li>Find the nullspace of matrix-function T([[x] [y] [z]]) = [[x + y - z] [0] [2x - z]].</li>
      
        <br><ul>Substituting each standard vector into the function: 
          <li>T(<b>i</b>) = [[1] [0] [2]]</li>
          
          <br><li>T(<b>j</b>) = [[1] [0] [0]]</li>
          
          <br><li>T(<b>k</b>) = [[-1] [0] [-1]]</li>
          
          <br><li>This results in the coefficient matrix [[1 1 -1] [0 0 0] [2 0 -1]] and system of equations {x + y - z = 0;  2x - z = 0}</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><ul>Solving for the variables: 
          <li>{x + y - z = 0;  2x - z = 0}</li>
          <li>y = z - x;  z = 2x</li>
          <li>y = 2x - x</li>
          <li>x = x;  y = x;  z = 2x</li>
          
          <br><li class="green">Therefore, the vector containing the solutions is x [[1] [1] [2]]. This is a line (subspace/nullspace) in 3D space</li>
