    <h2>Lecture 5.1: Eigenvalues</h2>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Eigenvalues</b>
      <li><b>Eigenvalues</b> are only applied to diagonal square matrices. These matrices have a size n ⨯ n, non-zero values on the main diagonal & all zeros outside the diagonal. The notation for eigenvalues is λ. They are also called characteristic values</li>
      
      <br><li>A matrix λ is an eigenvalue for matrix A if and only if there is a nonzero vector <b>v</b> (known as an <b>eigenvector</b>) so that the product of A * <b>v</b> is equal to the product of λ * <b>v</b>: </li>
        <ul class="red">if(A * <b>v</b> == λ * <b>v</b> && <b>v</b> != <b>0</b>) {λ = eigenvalue}</ul>
        <ul>(A<b>v</b> = λ<b>v</b>) is known as the eigenvalue equation</ul>
      
      <br><li>The eigenvalue equation can also be written in terms of a product of λ & an identity matrix I: </li>
        <ul>A<b>v</b> = λI<b>v</b></ul>
        <ul class="red">(A - λI)<b>v</b> = <b>0</b> (homogenous equation)</ul>
      
      <br><li>The set of eigenvectors {<b>v</b>} always form subspaces known as <b>eigenspaces</b> for λ. Eigenspaces, like subspaces, are closed under addition, where any vector can be added to a vector in the set and still have the same span, and closed in scalar multiplication, where any scalar can be multipled to a vector in the set and still have the same span</li>
        <ul>The eigenspace for λ is the nullspace of (A - λI):
          <li class="red">eigen(λ) = null(A - λI)</li>
        </ul>
      <li>let B = A - λI; If B<b>v</b> = <b>0</b>, then B has no inverse and the determinant of B is zero (det(B) == 0) because the nullity of B is greater than zero (null(B) > 0) && the rank of B is less than its size (rank(B) < n) && the columns/rows are dependent</li>
        <ul>If the determinant of B is zero, then the polynomial of λ is also zero. The polynomial p of λ is also called the characteristic polynomial: 
          <li class="red">det(A - λI) = det(B) = p(λ) = 0</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>The roots of p(λ) are the eigenvalues for matrix A</ul>
      
      <br><li>let D = [[λ<sub>1</sub> 0...0] [0 λ<sub>2</sub>...0]...[0...0 λ<sub>n</sub>]] (an infinite square diagonal matrix). The value of D raised to the m would be: </li>
        <ul>D<sup>m</sup> = [[λ<sub>1</sub><sup>m</sup> 0...0] [0 λ<sub>2</sub><sup>m</sup>...0]...[0...0 λ<sub>n</sub><sup>m</sup>]]</ul>
        
      <br><li>If a matrix is able to be represented as a diagonal matrix, it is <b>diagonalisable</b></li>
      
      <br><li>Eigenvectors formed from different eigenvalues are linearly independent</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="example"><b>Example 1: </b>
      <ol>Given matrix A = [[-9 -7] [14 12]], determine the eigenvalues for A, then find the basis for the nullspace of A.
      
        <br><li>Solving for λ using the zero determinant of (A - λI): </li>
          <ul>det(A - λI) = ((-9 - λ) * (12 - λ)) - (-7 * 14) == 0</ul>
          <ul>(λ<sup>2</sup> - 12λ + 9λ - 108) + 98 = 0</ul>
          <ul>λ<sup>2</sup> - 3λ - 10 = 0 (This is the polynomial of λ or p(λ))</ul>
          <ul>(λ - 5)(λ + 2) = 0</ul>
          <ul class="green">λ = {-2, 5}</ul>
        
        <br><li>Using the values of λ to find the basis for null(A): </li>
          <ul>For λ = 5: 
            <li>let B = A - 5I;</li>
            <li>B = [[(-9 - 5) -7] [14 (12 - 5)]]</li>

            <li>7y = -14x</li>
            <li>x(x) = x, y(x) = -2x (The variables written as a function in terms of x)</li>
            <li></li>
            <li class="green">The solutions/nullspace to the system of equations is the vector <b>w</b> = [[x] [-2x]] = x [[1] [-2]] for all x (spanning a line). The corresponding eigenvector is simply <b>v</b> = [[1] [-2]]. The basis B for the eigenspace is the set containing <b>v</b>. This is written as: </li>
              <ul>B<sub>(λ = 5)</sub> = {[[1] [-2]]}</ul>
            <li>This shows that [[-9 -7] [14 12]] [[1] [-2]] = 5 [[1] [-2]]</li>
