    <h1>Section 3.3: Phase Portraits for Linear Systems</h1>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Saddles</b>
      <li>A linear system containing a positive & negative eigenvalue forms a <b>saddle</b></li>
        <ul>The geometric representation of this form contains an equillibrium point (usually the origin) where one solution points towards it (negative eigenvalue) and another solution points away from it (positive eigenvalue)</ul>
        <ul>Equillibrium points of this form are considered <b>unstable</b></ul>
        <ul>In a saddle, the solution containing the negative eigenvalue is known as a separatrix</ul>
    </ul>
    
    <br><ul class="topic"><b>Sinks</b>
      <li>A linear system containing 2 distinct negative eigenvalues forms a <b>sink</b></li>
        <ul>The geometric representation of this form contains an equillibrium point (usually the origin) where both solutions points towards it</ul>
        <ul>Equillibrium points of this form are considered <b>stable</b></ul>
    </ul>
    
    <br><ul class="topic">Sources</ul>
      <li>A linear system containing 2 distinct positive eigenvalues forms a <b>source</b></li>
        <ul>The geometric representation of this form contains an equillibrium point (usually the origin) where both solutions points away from it</ul>
        <ul>Equillibrium points of this form are considered unstable, like saddles</ul>
