  		<h1>Section 2.6: Forced Oscillations</h1>
  		
  		<ul class="topic"><b>Beats</b>
  		  <li>The frequency of forced undamped oscillations are based upon a forcing frequency ω & natural frequency ω<sub>0</sub>. As long as {ω<sub>0</sub> - ω} is small (ω<sub>0</sub> is small or ω is large) && {ω == ω<}, the solution y(t) can be viewed as a since function with <b>amplitude modulation</b>: </li>
  		    <ul>y(t) = C cos(ω<sub>0</sub> t) + D sin(ω<sub>0</sub> t) + F<sub>0</sub> cos(ω t) / (a (ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> - ω<sup>2</sup>))</ul>
  		  <li>At ICs [y(0), y'(0)] = 0, the explicit solution is written: </li>
  		    <ul>y(t) = F<sub>0</sub> (cos(ω t) - cos(ω<sub>0</sub> t)) / (a (ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> - ω<sup>2</sup>))</ul>
  		    <ul>y(t) = -2 F<sub>0</sub> sin(((ω<sub>0</sub> - ω) t) / 2) sin(((ω + ω<sub>0</sub>) t) / 2)</ul>
  		    <ul>If ω & ω<sub>0</sub> are close in value, the first sine term sets the bounds of a slow oscillating wave for the second sine term to run within the first. This gives rise to a beating phenomenon/pattern (a sound frequncy that fades in and out continuously). The closer the natural & forcing frequency, the slower the fading effect (as long as they are not equal)</ul>
  		</ul>
  		
  		<ul class="topic"><b>Resonance</b>
  		  <li><b>Resonance</b> occurs when natural-frequency ω<sub>0</sub> is equal to forcing-frequency ω. The DE for this case is: {y'' + 4y = cos(2t)} having imaginary roots and a homogenous solution y<sub>h</sub>(t) = {C cos(2t) + D sin(2t)}. It will also have undetermined-coefficient {At cos(2t) + Bt sin(2t)} as a guess. The equation y(t) = t sin(2t) gives rise to an oscillating curve bounded by t but infinitely growing. This does not occur in the real world, as waves truly dissipate over time & do not grow infinitely large. This highlights the idea of <b>pure resonance</b> which is resonance (oscillations) that in theory grow infinitely large & no damping occurs. In reality, there is always some resistance which prevents pure resonance from occurring</li>
  		</ul>
  		
  		<ul class="topic"><b>Interpretation of Amplitude</b>
  		  <li>The amplitude R can be interpreted numerically using the following equation: </li>
  		    <ul>R c / F<sub>0</sub> = 1 / sqrt((b<sup>2</sup>/(ac)(w/w<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup>) + (1 - (w/w<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>), where R = amplitude of forced response, F<sub>0</sub>/c = amplitude of oscillating force</ul>
  		    <ul>R c / F<sub>0</sub> is the ratio of amplitudes between the 2 forces. let m = R c / F<sub>0</sub>; if(m > 1): amplitude of oscillating force is larger than that of a constant external force (<b>Practical Resonance</b>)</ul>
  		  
  		  <br><li>A graph of {R c / F<sub>0</sub>} over {w/w<sub>0</sub>} can be plotted using different damping coefficients to observe the behaviour of the amplitudes</li>
  		</ul>
