    <h1>Section 4.4: Steady-State Amplitude & Phase</h1>
    
    <ul><b>Steady-State Behaviour</b>
      <li>The behaviour of the solutions for a forced harmonic oscillator depends on the parameters ω (forcing frequency) & p (damping coefficient with mass accounted for)</li>
      
      <br><li>Since the long-term behaviour of solutions are the same, the specific solution to the harmonic oscillator can be generalised in the form: </li>
        <ul>$y_p(t) = A cos(ω t + φ)$, where $A = $ amplitude & $φ = $ phase angle</ul>
      
      <br><li>The solutions oscillate with the same frequency as the external force over time</li>
        <ul>When sufficient time has passed, the solutions at this point exhibit steady-state behaviour</ul>
      
      <br><li>As long as the damping is small, solutions to a forced harmonic oscillator equation behave approximately the same as in the undamped case for a bounded amount of time at the beginning of the oscillation</li>
      
      <br><li>To conveniently observe the steady-state behaviour of a harmonic oscillator, the solution  can be written in polar form: </li>
        <ul>$A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(q - ω^2)^2 + p^2 ω^2}}$</ul>
        <ul>$φ = atan(-\frac{p ω}{q - ω^2})$</ul>
      
      <br><li>The long-term behaviour of solutions are dependent on translations & scalings of the external force</li>
        <ul>The scaling is accomplished by the multiplication of the amplitude A</ul>
        <ul>The translations correspond to the addition of the phase angle φ</ul>
    </ul>
