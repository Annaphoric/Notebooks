    <h1>Section 1.3: Slope Fields</h1>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Slope Fields</b>
      <li>Given dy/dt = f(t, y), f(t, y) is the slope of the tangent line passing through point (t<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>), where y<sub>1</sub> = y(t<sub>1</sub>)</li>
      
      <br><li>The diagram showing slope lines to the direction of increasing t is known as a <b>slope field</b></li>
        <ul>Generally, the more slope lines drawn, the more defined the diagram</ul>
      <li>Many possible solutions can be distinguished by simply examining the graph by its trends</li>
      <li>There are also other analytical methods to determining solutions which will be explained at a later section</li>
      <li>The positions of the slope lines differ according to the integration constant after solving for the general solution to a DE</li>
      
      <br><li>The slope field of an autonomous DE, like dy/dt = f(y), is the same when shifted horizontally</li>
      <li>Solutions to this type of equation can be determined by using values for y in between equillibrium solutions, where dy/dt = 0</li>
      
      <br><li>If analytic methods, such as integration, cannot be used to solve a DE, qualitative analysis is the closest method that can be performed to understand the long-term behaviour of the function rather than an explicit solution</li>
      <li>This can be done by graphing the DE (forming a slope field) using different values of y</li>
        <ul>Equillibrium solutions of an autonomous D can be visualised by determining values of y where solutions to f(y) = t does not exist</ul>
    </ul>
