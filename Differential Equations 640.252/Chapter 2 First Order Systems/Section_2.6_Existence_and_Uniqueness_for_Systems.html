    <h1>Section 2.6: Existence & Uniqueness Theorems for Systems</h1>
    
    <ul class="topic"><b>Existence & Uniqueness Theorems for Systems</b>
      <li>These theorems are applied to systems in the same way as previously discussed</li>
      <li>The only difference is the consquences of the theorem matter more than the hypotheses themselves</li>
    
      <br><li>let vector field d<b>Y</b>/dt = <b>F</b>(t, <b>Y</b>) = {f(t, x, y), g(t, x, y)}, where <b>Y</b>(t) = (x(t), y(t)); there exists a bounded t<sub>0</sub> for a unique solution <b>Y</b>(t<sub>0</sub>) = <b>Y</b><sub>0</sub> as long the functions f & g and each of their 3 partial derivatives exist and are continuous</li>
      
      <br><li>For autonomous systems (where the DEs depend only on their respective dependent variables), the vector field does not vary with time and a solution cannot loop back & intersect with itself because it is a simple, closed curve</li>
    </ul>
